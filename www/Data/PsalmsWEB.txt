$ 18:1:1 Blessed is the man who doesn't walk in the counsel of the wicked , nor stand on the path of sinners , nor sit in the seat of scoffers ; 

$ 18:1:2 but his delight is in Yahweh's law . On his law he meditates day and night . 

$ 18:1:3 He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water , that produces its fruit in its season , whose leaf also does not wither . Whatever he does shall prosper . 

$ 18:1:4 The wicked are not so , but are like the chaff which the wind drives away . 

$ 18:1:5 Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment , nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous . 

$ 18:1:6 For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous , but the way of the wicked shall perish . 


$ 18:2:1 Why do the nations rage , and the peoples plot a vain thing ? 

$ 18:2:2 The kings of the earth take a stand , and the rulers take counsel together , against Yahweh , and against his Anointed , saying , 

$ 18:2:3 <" Let's break their bonds apart , and cast their cords from us . >" 

$ 18:2:4 He who sits in the heavens will laugh . The Lord will have them in derision . 

$ 18:2:5 Then he will speak to them in his anger , and terrify them in his wrath : 

$ 18:2:6 <" Yet I have set my King on my holy hill of Zion . >" 

$ 18:2:7 I will tell of the decree . Yahweh said to me , <" You are my son . Today I have become your father . 

$ 18:2:8 Ask of me , and I will give the nations for your inheritance , the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession . 

$ 18:2:9 You shall break them with a rod of iron . You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel . >" 

$ 18:2:10 Now therefore be wise , you kings . Be instructed , you judges of the earth . 

$ 18:2:11 Serve Yahweh with fear , and rejoice with trembling . 

$ 18:2:12 Give sincere homage to the Son , lest he be angry , and you perish on the way , for his wrath will soon be kindled . Blessed are all those who take refuge in him . 


$ 18:3:1 Yahweh , how my adversaries have increased ! Many are those who rise up against me . 

$ 18:3:2 Many there are who say of my soul , <" There is no help for him in God . >" Selah . 

$ 18:3:3 But you , Yahweh , are a shield around me , my glory , and the one who lifts up my head . 

$ 18:3:4 I cry to Yahweh with my voice , and he answers me out of his holy hill . Selah . 

$ 18:3:5 I laid myself down and slept . I awakened ; for Yahweh sustains me . 

$ 18:3:6 I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who have set themselves against me on every side . 

$ 18:3:7 Arise , Yahweh ! Save me , my God ! For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone . You have broken the teeth of the wicked . 

$ 18:3:8 Salvation belongs to Yahweh . Your blessing be on your people . Selah . 


$ 18:4:1 Answer me when I call , God of my righteousness . Give me relief from my distress . Have mercy on me , and hear my prayer . 

$ 18:4:2 You sons of men , how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor ? Will you love vanity , and seek after falsehood ? Selah . 

$ 18:4:3 But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly : Yahweh will hear when I call to him . 

$ 18:4:4 Stand in awe , and don't sin . Search your own heart on your bed , and be still . Selah . 

$ 18:4:5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness . Put your trust in Yahweh . 

$ 18:4:6 Many say , <" Who will show us any good ? >" Yahweh , let the light of your face shine on us . 

$ 18:4:7 You have put gladness in my heart , more than when their grain and their new wine are increased . 

$ 18:4:8 In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep , for you , Yahweh alone , make me live in safety . 


$ 18:5:1 Give ear to my words , Yahweh . Consider my meditation . 

$ 18:5:2 Listen to the voice of my cry , my King and my God ; for to you do I pray . 

$ 18:5:3 Yahweh , in the morning you shall hear my voice . In the morning I will lay my requests before you , and will watch expectantly . 

$ 18:5:4 For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness . Evil can't live with you . 

$ 18:5:5 The arrogant shall not stand in your sight . You hate all workers of iniquity . 

$ 18:5:6 You will destroy those who speak lies . Yahweh abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man . 

$ 18:5:7 But as for me , in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house . I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you . 

$ 18:5:8 Lead me , Yahweh , in your righteousness because of my enemies . Make your way straight before my face . 

$ 18:5:9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth . Their heart is destruction . Their throat is an open tomb . They flatter with their tongue . 

$ 18:5:10 Hold them guilty , God . Let them fall by their own counsels ; Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions , for they have rebelled against you . 

$ 18:5:11 But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice , Let them always shout for joy , because you defend them . Let them also who love your name be joyful in you . 

$ 18:5:12 For you will bless the righteous . Yahweh , you will surround him with favor as with a shield . 


$ 18:6:1 Yahweh , don't rebuke me in your anger , neither discipline me in your wrath . 

$ 18:6:2 Have mercy on me , Yahweh , for I am faint . Yahweh , heal me , for my bones are troubled . 

$ 18:6:3 My soul is also in great anguish . But you , Yahweh - how long ? 

$ 18:6:4 Return , Yahweh . Deliver my soul , and save me for your loving kindness' sake . 

$ 18:6:5 For in death there is no memory of you . In Sheol , who shall give you thanks ? 

$ 18:6:6 I am weary with my groaning . Every night I flood my bed . I drench my couch with my tears . 

$ 18:6:7 My eye wastes away because of grief . It grows old because of all my adversaries . 

$ 18:6:8 Depart from me , all you workers of iniquity , for Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping . 

$ 18:6:9 Yahweh has heard my supplication . Yahweh accepts my prayer . 

$ 18:6:10 May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed . They shall turn back , they shall be disgraced suddenly . 


$ 18:7:1 Yahweh , my God , I take refuge in you . Save me from all those who pursue me , and deliver me , 

$ 18:7:2 lest they tear apart my soul like a lion , ripping it in pieces , while there is no one to deliver . 

$ 18:7:3 Yahweh , my God , if I have done this , if there is iniquity in my hands , 

$ 18:7:4 if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me ( yes , I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary ) , 

$ 18:7:5 let the enemy pursue my soul , and overtake it ; yes , let him tread my life down to the earth , and lay my glory in the dust . Selah . 

$ 18:7:6 Arise , Yahweh , in your anger . Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries . Awake for me . You have commanded judgment . 

$ 18:7:7 Let the congregation of the peoples surround you . Rule over them on high . 

$ 18:7:8 Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples . Judge me , Yahweh , according to my righteousness , and to my integrity that is in me . 

$ 18:7:9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end , but establish the righteous ; their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God . 

$ 18:7:10 My shield is with God , who saves the upright in heart . 

$ 18:7:11 God is a righteous judge , yes , a God who has indignation every day . 

$ 18:7:12 If a man doesn't repent , he will sharpen his sword ; he has bent and strung his bow . 

$ 18:7:13 He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death . He makes ready his flaming arrows . 

$ 18:7:14 Behold , he travails with iniquity . Yes , he has conceived mischief , and brought out falsehood . 

$ 18:7:15 He has dug a hole , and has fallen into the pit which he made . 

$ 18:7:16 The trouble he causes shall return to his own head . His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head . 

$ 18:7:17 I will give thanks to Yahweh according to his righteousness , and will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most High . 


$ 18:8:1 Yahweh , our Lord , how majestic is your name in all the earth , who has set your glory above the heavens ! 

$ 18:8:2 From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength , because of your adversaries , that you might silence the enemy and the avenger . 

$ 18:8:3 When I consider your heavens , the work of your fingers , the moon and the stars , which you have ordained ; 

$ 18:8:4 what is man , that you think of him ? What is the son of man , that you care for him ? 

$ 18:8:5 For you have made him a little lower than the angels , and crowned him with glory and honor . 

$ 18:8:6 You make him ruler over the works of your hands . You have put all things under his feet : 

$ 18:8:7 All sheep and cattle , yes , and the animals of the field , 

$ 18:8:8 the birds of the sky , the fish of the sea , and whatever passes through the paths of the seas . 

$ 18:8:9 Yahweh , our Lord , how majestic is your name in all the earth ! 


$ 18:9:1 I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart . I will tell of all your marvelous works . 

$ 18:9:2 I will be glad and rejoice in you . I will sing praise to your name , O Most High . 

$ 18:9:3 When my enemies turn back , they stumble and perish in your presence . 

$ 18:9:4 For you have maintained my just cause . You sit on the throne judging righteously . 

$ 18:9:5 You have rebuked the nations . You have destroyed the wicked . You have blotted out their name forever and ever . 

$ 18:9:6 The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin . The very memory of the cities which you have overthrown has perished . 

$ 18:9:7 But Yahweh reigns forever . He has prepared his throne for judgment . 

$ 18:9:8 He will judge the world in righteousness . He will administer judgment to the peoples in uprightness . 

$ 18:9:9 Yahweh will also be a high tower for the oppressed ; a high tower in times of trouble . 

$ 18:9:10 Those who know your name will put their trust in you , for you , Yahweh , have not forsaken those who seek you . 

$ 18:9:11 Sing praises to Yahweh , who dwells in Zion , and declare among the people what he has done . 

$ 18:9:12 For he who avenges blood remembers them . He doesn't forget the cry of the afflicted . 

$ 18:9:13 Have mercy on me , Yahweh . See my affliction by those who hate me , and lift me up from the gates of death ; 

$ 18:9:14 that I may show all of your praise . In the gates of the daughter of Zion , I will rejoice in your salvation . 

$ 18:9:15 The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made . In the net which they hid , their own foot is taken . 

$ 18:9:16 Yahweh has made himself known . He has executed judgment . The wicked is snared by the work of his own hands . Meditation . Selah . 

$ 18:9:17 The wicked shall be turned back to Sheol , even all the nations that forget God . 

$ 18:9:18 For the needy shall not always be forgotten , nor the hope of the poor perish forever . 

$ 18:9:19 Arise , Yahweh ! Don't let man prevail . Let the nations be judged in your sight . 

$ 18:9:20 Put them in fear , Yahweh . Let the nations know that they are only men . Selah . 


$ 18:10:1 Why do you stand far off , Yahweh ? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble ? 

$ 18:10:2 In arrogance , the wicked hunt down the weak . They are caught in the schemes that they devise . 

$ 18:10:3 For the wicked boasts of his heart's cravings . He blesses the greedy , and condemns Yahweh . 

$ 18:10:4 The wicked , in the pride of his face , has no room in his thoughts for God . 

$ 18:10:5 His ways are prosperous at all times . He is arrogant , and your laws are far from his sight . As for all his adversaries , he sneers at them . 

$ 18:10:6 He says in his heart , <" I shall not be shaken . For generations I shall have no trouble . >" 

$ 18:10:7 His mouth is full of cursing , deceit , and oppression . Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity . 

$ 18:10:8 He lies in wait near the villages . From ambushes , he murders the innocent . His eyes are secretly set against the helpless . 

$ 18:10:9 He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush . He lies in wait to catch the helpless . He catches the helpless , when he draws him in his net . 

$ 18:10:10 The helpless are crushed . They collapse . They fall under his strength . 

$ 18:10:11 He says in his heart , <" God has forgotten . He hides his face . He will never see it . >" 

$ 18:10:12 Arise , Yahweh ! God , lift up your hand ! Don't forget the helpless . 

$ 18:10:13 Why does the wicked person condemn God , and say in his heart , <" God won't call me into account ? >" 

$ 18:10:14 But you do see trouble and grief . You consider it to take it into your hand . You help the victim and the fatherless . 

$ 18:10:15 Break the arm of the wicked . As for the evil man , seek out his wickedness until you find none . 

$ 18:10:16 Yahweh is King forever and ever ! The nations will perish out of his land . 

$ 18:10:17 Yahweh , you have heard the desire of the humble . You will prepare their heart . You will cause your ear to hear , 

$ 18:10:18 to judge the fatherless and the oppressed , that man who is of the earth may terrify no more . 


$ 18:11:1 In Yahweh , I take refuge . How can you say to my soul , <" Flee as a bird to your mountain ! >" 

$ 18:11:2 For , behold , the wicked bend their bows . They set their arrows on the strings , that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart . 

$ 18:11:3 If the foundations are destroyed , what can the righteous do ? 

$ 18:11:4 Yahweh is in his holy temple . Yahweh is on his throne in heaven . His eyes observe . His eyes examine the children of men . 

$ 18:11:5 Yahweh examines the righteous , but the wicked and him who loves violence his soul hates . 

$ 18:11:6 On the wicked he will rain blazing coals ; fire , sulfur , and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup . 

$ 18:11:7 For Yahweh is righteous . He loves righteousness . The upright shall see his face . 


$ 18:12:1 Help , Yahweh ; for the godly man ceases . For the faithful fail from among the children of men . 

$ 18:12:2 Everyone lies to his neighbor . They speak with flattering lips , and with a double heart . 

$ 18:12:3 May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips , and the tongue that boasts , 

$ 18:12:4 who have said , <" With our tongue we will prevail . Our lips are our own . Who is lord over us ? >" 

$ 18:12:5 <" Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy , I will now arise , >" says Yahweh ; <" I will set him in safety from those who malign him . >" 

$ 18:12:6 Yahweh's words are flawless words , as silver refined in a clay furnace , purified seven times . 

$ 18:12:7 You will keep them , Yahweh . You will preserve them from this generation forever . 

$ 18:12:8 The wicked walk on every side , when what is vile is exalted among the sons of men . 


$ 18:13:1 How long , Yahweh ? Will you forget me forever ? How long will you hide your face from me ? 

$ 18:13:2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul , having sorrow in my heart every day ? How long shall my enemy triumph over me ? 

$ 18:13:3 Behold , and answer me , Yahweh , my God . Give light to my eyes , lest I sleep in death ; 

$ 18:13:4 lest my enemy say , <" I have prevailed against him ; >" lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall . 

$ 18:13:5 But I trust in your loving kindness . My heart rejoices in your salvation . 

$ 18:13:6 I will sing to Yahweh , because he has been good to me . 


$ 18:14:1 The fool has said in his heart , <" There is no God . >" They are corrupt . They have done abominable deeds . There is no one who does good . 

$ 18:14:2 Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men , to see if there were any who understood , who sought after God . 

$ 18:14:3 They have all gone aside . They have together become corrupt . There is no one who does good , no , not one . 

$ 18:14:4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge , who eat up my people as they eat bread , and don't call on Yahweh ? 

$ 18:14:5 There they were in great fear , for God is in the generation of the righteous . 

$ 18:14:6 You frustrate the plan of the poor , because Yahweh is his refuge . 

$ 18:14:7 Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion ! When Yahweh restores the fortunes of his people , then Jacob shall rejoice , and Israel shall be glad . 


$ 18:15:1 Yahweh , who shall dwell in your sanctuary ? Who shall live on your holy hill ? 

$ 18:15:2 He who walks blamelessly does what is right , and speaks truth in his heart ; 

$ 18:15:3 He who doesn't slander with his tongue , nor does evil to his friend , nor casts slurs against his fellow man ; 

$ 18:15:4 In whose eyes a vile man is despised , but who honors those who fear Yahweh ; he who keeps an oath even when it hurts , and doesn't change ; 

$ 18:15:5 he who doesn't lend out his money for usury , nor take a bribe against the innocent . He who does these things shall never be shaken . 


$ 18:16:1 Preserve me , God , for I take refuge in you . 

$ 18:16:2 My soul , you have said to Yahweh , <" You are my Lord . Apart from you I have no good thing . >" 

$ 18:16:3 As for the saints who are in the earth , they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight . 

$ 18:16:4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god . Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer , nor take their names on my lips . 

$ 18:16:5 Yahweh assigned my portion and my cup . You made my lot secure . 

$ 18:16:6 The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places . Yes , I have a good inheritance . 

$ 18:16:7 I will bless Yahweh , who has given me counsel . Yes , my heart instructs me in the night seasons . 

$ 18:16:8 I have set Yahweh always before me . Because he is at my right hand , I shall not be moved . 

$ 18:16:9 Therefore my heart is glad , and my tongue rejoices . My body shall also dwell in safety . 

$ 18:16:10 For you will not leave my soul in Sheol , neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption . 

$ 18:16:11 You will show me the path of life . In your presence is fullness of joy . In your right hand there are pleasures forever more . 


$ 18:17:1 Hear , Yahweh , my righteous plea ; Give ear to my prayer , that doesn't go out of deceitful lips . 

$ 18:17:2 Let my sentence come out of your presence . Let your eyes look on equity . 

$ 18:17:3 You have proved my heart . You have visited me in the night . You have tried me , and found nothing . I have resolved that my mouth shall not disobey . 

$ 18:17:4 As for the deeds of men , by the word of your lips , I have kept myself from the ways of the violent . 

$ 18:17:5 My steps have held fast to your paths . My feet have not slipped . 

$ 18:17:6 I have called on you , for you will answer me , God . Turn your ear to me . Hear my speech . 

$ 18:17:7 Show your marvelous loving kindness , you who save those who take refuge by your right hand from their enemies . 

$ 18:17:8 Keep me as the apple of your eye . Hide me under the shadow of your wings , 

$ 18:17:9 from the wicked who oppress me , my deadly enemies , who surround me . 

$ 18:17:10 They close up their callous hearts . With their mouth they speak proudly . 

$ 18:17:11 They have now surrounded us in our steps . They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth . 

$ 18:17:12 He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey , as it were a young lion lurking in secret places . 

$ 18:17:13 Arise , Yahweh , confront him . Cast him down . Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword ; 

$ 18:17:14 from men by your hand , Yahweh , from men of the world , whose portion is in this life . You fill the belly of your cherished ones . Your sons have plenty , and they store up wealth for their children . 

$ 18:17:15 As for me , I shall see your face in righteousness . I shall be satisfied , when I awake , with seeing your form . 
delivered him from the hand of all his enemies , and from the hand of Saul . He said , 

$ 18:18:1 I love you , Yahweh , my strength . 

$ 18:18:2 Yahweh is my rock , my fortress , and my deliverer ; my God , my rock , in whom I take refuge ; my shield , and the horn of my salvation , my high tower . 

$ 18:18:3 I call on Yahweh , who is worthy to be praised ; and I am saved from my enemies . 

$ 18:18:4 The cords of death surrounded me . The floods of ungodliness made me afraid . 

$ 18:18:5 The cords of Sheol were around me . The snares of death came on me . 

$ 18:18:6 In my distress I called on Yahweh , and cried to my God . He heard my voice out of his temple . My cry before him came into his ears . 

$ 18:18:7 Then the earth shook and trembled . The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken , because he was angry . 

$ 18:18:8 Smoke went out of his nostrils . Consuming fire came out of his mouth . Coals were kindled by it . 

$ 18:18:9 He bowed the heavens also , and came down . Thick darkness was under his feet . 

$ 18:18:10 He rode on a cherub , and flew . Yes , he soared on the wings of the wind . 

$ 18:18:11 He made darkness his hiding place , his pavilion around him , darkness of waters , thick clouds of the skies . 

$ 18:18:12 At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed , hailstones and coals of fire . 

$ 18:18:13 Yahweh also thundered in the sky . The Most High uttered his voice : hailstones and coals of fire . 

$ 18:18:14 He sent out his arrows , and scattered them ; Yes , great lightning bolts , and routed them . 

$ 18:18:15 Then the channels of waters appeared . The foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke , Yahweh , at the blast of the breath of your nostrils . 

$ 18:18:16 He sent from on high . He took me . He drew me out of many waters . 

$ 18:18:17 He delivered me from my strong enemy , from those who hated me ; for they were too mighty for me . 

$ 18:18:18 They came on me in the day of my calamity , but Yahweh was my support . 

$ 18:18:19 He brought me out also into a large place . He delivered me , because he delighted in me . 

$ 18:18:20 Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness . According to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me . 

$ 18:18:21 For I have kept the ways of Yahweh , and have not wickedly departed from my God . 

$ 18:18:22 For all his ordinances were before me . I didn't put away his statutes from me . 

$ 18:18:23 I was also blameless with him . I kept myself from my iniquity . 

$ 18:18:24 Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness , according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight . 

$ 18:18:25 With the merciful you will show yourself merciful . With the perfect man , you will show yourself perfect . 

$ 18:18:26 With the pure , you will show yourself pure . With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd . 

$ 18:18:27 For you will save the afflicted people , but the arrogant eyes you will bring down . 

$ 18:18:28 For you will light my lamp , Yahweh . My God will light up my darkness . 

$ 18:18:29 For by you , I advance through a troop . By my God , I leap over a wall . 

$ 18:18:30 As for God , his way is perfect . Yahweh's word is tried . He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him . 

$ 18:18:31 For who is God , except Yahweh ? Who is a rock , besides our God , 

$ 18:18:32 the God who arms me with strength , and makes my way perfect ? 

$ 18:18:33 He makes my feet like deer's feet , and sets me on my high places . 

$ 18:18:34 He teaches my hands to war , so that my arms bend a bow of bronze . 

$ 18:18:35 You have also given me the shield of your salvation . Your right hand sustains me . Your gentleness has made me great . 

$ 18:18:36 You have enlarged my steps under me , My feet have not slipped . 

$ 18:18:37 I will pursue my enemies , and overtake them . I won't turn away until they are consumed . 

$ 18:18:38 I will strike them through , so that they will not be able to rise . They shall fall under my feet . 

$ 18:18:39 For you have armed me with strength to the battle . You have subdued under me those who rose up against me . 

$ 18:18:40 You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me , that I might cut off those who hate me . 

$ 18:18:41 They cried , but there was no one to save ; even to Yahweh , but he didn't answer them . 

$ 18:18:42 Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind . I cast them out as the mire of the streets . 

$ 18:18:43 You have delivered me from the strivings of the people . You have made me the head of the nations . A people whom I have not known shall serve me . 

$ 18:18:44 As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me . The foreigners shall submit themselves to me . 

$ 18:18:45 The foreigners shall fade away , and shall come trembling out of their strongholds . 

$ 18:18:46 Yahweh lives ; and blessed be my rock . Exalted be the God of my salvation , 

$ 18:18:47 even the God who executes vengeance for me , and subdues peoples under me . 

$ 18:18:48 He rescues me from my enemies . Yes , you lift me up above those who rise up against me . You deliver me from the violent man . 

$ 18:18:49 Therefore I will give thanks to you , Yahweh , among the nations , and will sing praises to your name . 

$ 18:18:50 He gives great deliverance to his king , and shows loving kindness to his anointed , to David and to his offspring , forever more . 


$ 18:19:1 The heavens declare the glory of God . The expanse shows his handiwork . 

$ 18:19:2 Day after day they pour out speech , and night after night they display knowledge . 

$ 18:19:3 There is no speech nor language , where their voice is not heard . 

$ 18:19:4 Their voice has gone out through all the earth , their words to the end of the world . In them he has set a tent for the sun , 

$ 18:19:5 which is as a bridegroom coming out of his room , like a strong man rejoicing to run his course . 

$ 18:19:6 His going out is from the end of the heavens , his circuit to its ends ; There is nothing hidden from its heat . 

$ 18:19:7 Yahweh's law is perfect , restoring the soul . Yahweh's covenant is sure , making wise the simple . 

$ 18:19:8 Yahweh's precepts are right , rejoicing the heart . Yahweh's commandment is pure , enlightening the eyes . 

$ 18:19:9 The fear of Yahweh is clean , enduring forever . Yahweh's ordinances are true , and righteous altogether . 

$ 18:19:10 More to be desired are they than gold , yes , than much fine gold ; sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb . 

$ 18:19:11 Moreover by them is your servant warned . In keeping them there is great reward . 

$ 18:19:12 Who can discern his errors ? Forgive me from hidden errors . 

$ 18:19:13 Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins . Let them not have dominion over me . Then I will be upright . I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression . 

$ 18:19:14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight , Yahweh , my rock , and my redeemer . 


$ 18:20:1 May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble . May the name of the God of Jacob set you up on high , 

$ 18:20:2 send you help from the sanctuary , grant you support from Zion , 

$ 18:20:3 remember all your offerings , and accept your burned sacrifice . Selah . 

$ 18:20:4 May He grant you your heart's desire , and fulfill all your counsel . 

$ 18:20:5 We will triumph in your salvation . In the name of our God , we will set up our banners . May Yahweh grant all your requests . 

$ 18:20:6 Now I know that Yahweh saves his anointed . He will answer him from his holy heaven , with the saving strength of his right hand . 

$ 18:20:7 Some trust in chariots , and some in horses , but we trust the name of Yahweh our God . 

$ 18:20:8 They are bowed down and fallen , but we rise up , and stand upright . 

$ 18:20:9 Save , Yahweh ! Let the King answer us when we call ! 


$ 18:21:1 The king rejoices in your strength , Yahweh ! How greatly he rejoices in your salvation ! 

$ 18:21:2 You have given him his heart's desire , and have not withheld the request of his lips . Selah . 

$ 18:21:3 For you meet him with the blessings of goodness . You set a crown of fine gold on his head . 

$ 18:21:4 He asked life of you , you gave it to him , even length of days forever and ever . 

$ 18:21:5 His glory is great in your salvation . You lay honor and majesty on him . 

$ 18:21:6 For you make him most blessed forever . You make him glad with joy in your presence . 

$ 18:21:7 For the king trusts in Yahweh . Through the loving kindness of the Most High , he shall not be moved . 

$ 18:21:8 Your hand will find out all of your enemies . Your right hand will find out those who hate you . 

$ 18:21:9 You will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger . Yahweh will swallow them up in his wrath . The fire shall devour them . 

$ 18:21:10 You will destroy their descendants from the earth , their posterity from among the children of men . 

$ 18:21:11 For they intended evil against you . They plotted evil against you which cannot succeed . 

$ 18:21:12 For you will make them turn their back , when you aim drawn bows at their face . 

$ 18:21:13 Be exalted , Yahweh , in your strength , so we will sing and praise your power . 


$ 18:22:1 My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? Why are you so far from helping me , and from the words of my groaning ? 

$ 18:22:2 My God , I cry in the daytime , but you don't answer ; in the night season , and am not silent . 

$ 18:22:3 But you are holy , you who inhabit the praises of Israel . 

$ 18:22:4 Our fathers trusted in you . They trusted , and you delivered them . 

$ 18:22:5 They cried to you , and were delivered . They trusted in you , and were not disappointed . 

$ 18:22:6 But I am a worm , and no man ; a reproach of men , and despised by the people . 

$ 18:22:7 All those who see me mock me . They insult me with their lips . They shake their heads , saying , 

$ 18:22:8 <" He trusts in Yahweh . Let him deliver him . Let him rescue him , since he delights in him . >" 

$ 18:22:9 But you brought me out of the womb . You made me trust while at my mother's breasts . 

$ 18:22:10 I was thrown on you from my mother's womb . You are my God since my mother bore me . 

$ 18:22:11 Don't be far from me , for trouble is near . For there is no one to help . 

$ 18:22:12 Many bulls have surrounded me . Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled me . 

$ 18:22:13 They open their mouths wide against me , lions tearing prey and roaring . 

$ 18:22:14 I am poured out like water . All my bones are out of joint . My heart is like wax ; it is melted within me . 

$ 18:22:15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd . My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth . You have brought me into the dust of death . 

$ 18:22:16 For dogs have surrounded me . A company of evildoers have enclosed me . They have pierced my hands and feet . 

$ 18:22:17 I can count all of my bones . They look and stare at me . 

$ 18:22:18 They divide my garments among them . They cast lots for my clothing . 

$ 18:22:19 But don't be far off , Yahweh . You are my help : hurry to help me . 

$ 18:22:20 Deliver my soul from the sword , my precious life from the power of the dog . 

$ 18:22:21 Save me from the lion's mouth ! Yes , from the horns of the wild oxen , you have answered me . 

$ 18:22:22 I will declare your name to my brothers . Among the assembly , I will praise you . 

$ 18:22:23 You who fear Yahweh , praise him ! All you descendants of Jacob , glorify him ! Stand in awe of him , all you descendants of Israel ! 

$ 18:22:24 For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted , Neither has he hidden his face from him ; but when he cried to him , he heard . 

$ 18:22:25 Of you comes my praise in the great assembly . I will pay my vows before those who fear him . 

$ 18:22:26 The humble shall eat and be satisfied . They shall praise Yahweh who seek after him . Let your hearts live forever . 

$ 18:22:27 All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to Yahweh . All the relatives of the nations shall worship before you . 

$ 18:22:28 For the kingdom is Yahweh's . He is the ruler over the nations . 

$ 18:22:29 All the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship . All those who go down to the dust shall bow before him , even he who can't keep his soul alive . 

$ 18:22:30 Posterity shall serve him . Future generations shall be told about the Lord . 

$ 18:22:31 They shall come and shall declare his righteousness to a people that shall be born , for he has done it . 


$ 18:23:1 Yahweh is my shepherd : I shall lack nothing . 

$ 18:23:2 He makes me lie down in green pastures . He leads me beside still waters . 

$ 18:23:3 He restores my soul . He guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake . 

$ 18:23:4 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil , for you are with me . Your rod and your staff , they comfort me . 

$ 18:23:5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies . You anoint my head with oil . My cup runs over . 

$ 18:23:6 Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life , and I will dwell in Yahweh's house forever . 


$ 18:24:1 The earth is Yahweh's , with its fullness ; the world , and those who dwell therein . 

$ 18:24:2 For he has founded it on the seas , and established it on the floods . 

$ 18:24:3 Who may ascend to Yahweh's hill ? Who may stand in his holy place ? 

$ 18:24:4 He who has clean hands and a pure heart ; who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood , and has not sworn deceitfully . 

$ 18:24:5 He shall receive a blessing from Yahweh , righteousness from the God of his salvation . 

$ 18:24:6 This is the generation of those who seek Him , who seek your face - even Jacob . Selah . 

$ 18:24:7 Lift up your heads , you gates ! Be lifted up , you everlasting doors , and the King of glory will come in . 

$ 18:24:8 Who is the King of glory ? Yahweh strong and mighty , Yahweh mighty in battle . 

$ 18:24:9 Lift up your heads , you gates ; yes , lift them up , you everlasting doors , and the King of glory will come in . 

$ 18:24:10 Who is this King of glory ? Yahweh of Armies is the King of glory ! Selah . 


$ 18:25:1 To you , Yahweh , do I lift up my soul . 

$ 18:25:2 My God , I have trusted in you . Don't let me be shamed . Don't let my enemies triumph over me . 

$ 18:25:3 Yes , no one who waits for you shall be shamed . They shall be shamed who deal treacherously without cause . 

$ 18:25:4 Show me your ways , Yahweh . Teach me your paths . 

$ 18:25:5 Guide me in your truth , and teach me , For you are the God of my salvation , I wait for you all day long . 

$ 18:25:6 Yahweh , remember your tender mercies and your loving kindness , for they are from old times . 

$ 18:25:7 Don't remember the sins of my youth , nor my transgressions . Remember me according to your loving kindness , for your goodness' sake , Yahweh . 

$ 18:25:8 Good and upright is Yahweh , therefore he will instruct sinners in the way . 

$ 18:25:9 He will guide the humble in justice . He will teach the humble his way . 

$ 18:25:10 All the paths of Yahweh are loving kindness and truth to such as keep his covenant and his testimonies . 

$ 18:25:11 For your name's sake , Yahweh , pardon my iniquity , for it is great . 

$ 18:25:12 What man is he who fears Yahweh ? He shall instruct him in the way that he shall choose . 

$ 18:25:13 His soul shall dwell at ease . His offspring shall inherit the land . 

$ 18:25:14 The friendship of Yahweh is with those who fear him . He will show them his covenant . 

$ 18:25:15 My eyes are ever on Yahweh , for he will pluck my feet out of the net . 

$ 18:25:16 Turn to me , and have mercy on me , for I am desolate and afflicted . 

$ 18:25:17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged . Oh bring me out of my distresses . 

$ 18:25:18 Consider my affliction and my travail . Forgive all my sins . 

$ 18:25:19 Consider my enemies , for they are many . They hate me with cruel hatred . 

$ 18:25:20 Oh keep my soul , and deliver me . Let me not be disappointed , for I take refuge in you . 

$ 18:25:21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me , for I wait for you . 

$ 18:25:22 Redeem Israel , God , out of all his troubles . 


$ 18:26:1 Judge me , Yahweh , for I have walked in my integrity . I have trusted also in Yahweh without wavering . 

$ 18:26:2 Examine me , Yahweh , and prove me . Try my heart and my mind . 

$ 18:26:3 For your loving kindness is before my eyes . I have walked in your truth . 

$ 18:26:4 I have not sat with deceitful men , neither will I go in with hypocrites . 

$ 18:26:5 I hate the assembly of evildoers , and will not sit with the wicked . 

$ 18:26:6 I will wash my hands in innocence , so I will go about your altar , Yahweh ; 

$ 18:26:7 that I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard , and tell of all your wondrous deeds . 

$ 18:26:8 Yahweh , I love the habitation of your house , the place where your glory dwells . 

$ 18:26:9 Don't gather my soul with sinners , nor my life with bloodthirsty men ; 

$ 18:26:10 in whose hands is wickedness , their right hand is full of bribes . 

$ 18:26:11 But as for me , I will walk in my integrity . Redeem me , and be merciful to me . 

$ 18:26:12 My foot stands in an even place . In the congregations I will bless Yahweh . 


$ 18:27:1 Yahweh is my light and my salvation . Whom shall I fear ? Yahweh is the strength of my life . Of whom shall I be afraid ? 

$ 18:27:2 When evildoers came at me to eat up my flesh , even my adversaries and my foes , they stumbled and fell . 

$ 18:27:3 Though an army should encamp against me , my heart shall not fear . Though war should rise against me , even then I will be confident . 

$ 18:27:4 One thing I have asked of Yahweh , that I will seek after : that I may dwell in Yahweh's house all the days of my life , to see Yahweh's beauty , and to inquire in his temple . 

$ 18:27:5 For in the day of trouble , he will keep me secretly in his pavilion . In the secret place of his tabernacle , he will hide me . He will lift me up on a rock . 

$ 18:27:6 Now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me ; I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent . I will sing , yes , I will sing praises to Yahweh . 

$ 18:27:7 Hear , Yahweh , when I cry with my voice . Have mercy also on me , and answer me . 

$ 18:27:8 When you said , <" Seek my face , >" my heart said to you , <" I will seek your face , Yahweh . >" 

$ 18:27:9 Don't hide your face from me . Don't put your servant away in anger . You have been my help . Don't abandon me , neither forsake me , God of my salvation . 

$ 18:27:10 When my father and my mother forsake me , then Yahweh will take me up . 

$ 18:27:11 Teach me your way , Yahweh . Lead me in a straight path , because of my enemies . 

$ 18:27:12 Don't deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries , for false witnesses have risen up against me , such as breathe out cruelty . 

$ 18:27:13 I am still confident of this : I will see the goodness of Yahweh in the land of the living . 

$ 18:27:14 Wait for Yahweh . Be strong , and let your heart take courage . Yes , wait for Yahweh . 


$ 18:28:1 To you , Yahweh , I call . My rock , don't be deaf to me ; lest , if you are silent to me , I would become like those who go down into the pit . 

$ 18:28:2 Hear the voice of my petitions , when I cry to you , when I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place . 

$ 18:28:3 Don't draw me away with the wicked , with the workers of iniquity who speak peace with their neighbors , but mischief is in their hearts . 

$ 18:28:4 Give them according to their work , and according to the wickedness of their doings . Give them according to the operation of their hands . Bring back on them what they deserve . 

$ 18:28:5 Because they don't respect the works of Yahweh , nor the operation of his hands , he will break them down and not build them up . 

$ 18:28:6 Blessed be Yahweh , because he has heard the voice of my petitions . 

$ 18:28:7 Yahweh is my strength and my shield . My heart has trusted in him , and I am helped . Therefore my heart greatly rejoices . With my song I will thank him . 

$ 18:28:8 Yahweh is their strength . He is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed . 

$ 18:28:9 Save your people , and bless your inheritance . Be their shepherd also , and bear them up forever . 


$ 18:29:1 Ascribe to Yahweh , you sons of the mighty , ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength . 

$ 18:29:2 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name . Worship Yahweh in holy array . 

$ 18:29:3 Yahweh's voice is on the waters . The God of glory thunders , even Yahweh on many waters . 

$ 18:29:4 Yahweh's voice is powerful . Yahweh's voice is full of majesty . 

$ 18:29:5 Yahweh's voice breaks the cedars . Yes , Yahweh breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon . 

$ 18:29:6 He makes them also to skip like a calf ; Lebanon and Sirion like a young , wild ox . 

$ 18:29:7 Yahweh's voice strikes with flashes of lightning . 

$ 18:29:8 Yahweh's voice shakes the wilderness . Yahweh shakes the wilderness of Kadesh . 

$ 18:29:9 Yahweh's voice makes the deer calve , and strips the forests bare . In his temple everything says , <" Glory ! >" 

$ 18:29:10 Yahweh sat enthroned at the Flood . Yes , Yahweh sits as King forever . 

$ 18:29:11 Yahweh will give strength to his people . Yahweh will bless his people with peace . 


$ 18:30:1 I will extol you , Yahweh , for you have raised me up , and have not made my foes to rejoice over me . 

$ 18:30:2 Yahweh my God , I cried to you , and you have healed me . 

$ 18:30:3 Yahweh , you have brought up my soul from Sheol . You have kept me alive , that I should not go down to the pit . 

$ 18:30:4 Sing praise to Yahweh , you saints of his . Give thanks to his holy name . 

$ 18:30:5 For his anger is but for a moment . His favor is for a lifetime . Weeping may stay for the night , but joy comes in the morning . 

$ 18:30:6 As for me , I said in my prosperity , <" I shall never be moved . >" 

$ 18:30:7 You , Yahweh , when you favored me , made my mountain stand strong ; but when you hid your face , I was troubled . 

$ 18:30:8 I cried to you , Yahweh . I made supplication to the Lord : 

$ 18:30:9 <" What profit is there in my destruction , if I go down to the pit ? Shall the dust praise you ? Shall it declare your truth ? 

$ 18:30:10 Hear , Yahweh , and have mercy on me . Yahweh , be my helper . >" 

$ 18:30:11 You have turned my mourning into dancing for me . You have removed my sackcloth , and clothed me with gladness , 

$ 18:30:12 to the end that my heart may sing praise to you , and not be silent . Yahweh my God , I will give thanks to you forever ! 


$ 18:31:1 In you , Yahweh , I take refuge . Let me never be disappointed . Deliver me in your righteousness . 

$ 18:31:2 Bow down your ear to me . Deliver me speedily . Be to me a strong rock , a house of defense to save me . 

$ 18:31:3 For you are my rock and my fortress , therefore for your name's sake lead me and guide me . 

$ 18:31:4 Pluck me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me , for you are my stronghold . 

$ 18:31:5 Into your hand I commend my spirit . You redeem me , Yahweh , God of truth . 

$ 18:31:6 I hate those who regard lying vanities , but I trust in Yahweh . 

$ 18:31:7 I will be glad and rejoice in your loving kindness , for you have seen my affliction . You have known my soul in adversities . 

$ 18:31:8 You have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy . You have set my feet in a large place . 

$ 18:31:9 Have mercy on me , Yahweh , for I am in distress . My eye , my soul , and my body waste away with grief . 

$ 18:31:10 For my life is spent with sorrow , my years with sighing . My strength fails because of my iniquity . My bones are wasted away . 

$ 18:31:11 Because of all my adversaries I have become utterly contemptible to my neighbors , a horror to my acquaintances . Those who saw me on the street fled from me . 

$ 18:31:12 I am forgotten from their hearts like a dead man . I am like broken pottery . 

$ 18:31:13 For I have heard the slander of many , terror on every side , while they conspire together against me , they plot to take away my life . 

$ 18:31:14 But I trust in you , Yahweh . I said , <" You are my God . >" 

$ 18:31:15 My times are in your hand . Deliver me from the hand of my enemies , and from those who persecute me . 

$ 18:31:16 Make your face to shine on your servant . Save me in your loving kindness . 

$ 18:31:17 Let me not be disappointed , Yahweh , for I have called on you . Let the wicked be disappointed . Let them be silent in Sheol . 

$ 18:31:18 Let the lying lips be mute , which speak against the righteous insolently , with pride and contempt . 

$ 18:31:19 Oh how great is your goodness , which you have laid up for those who fear you , which you have worked for those who take refuge in you , before the sons of men ! 

$ 18:31:20 In the shelter of your presence you will hide them from the plotting of man . You will keep them secretly in a dwelling away from the strife of tongues . 

$ 18:31:21 Praise be to Yahweh , for he has shown me his marvelous loving kindness in a strong city . 

$ 18:31:22 As for me , I said in my haste , <" I am cut off from before your eyes . >" Nevertheless you heard the voice of my petitions when I cried to you . 

$ 18:31:23 Oh love Yahweh , all you his saints ! Yahweh preserves the faithful , and fully recompenses him who behaves arrogantly . 

$ 18:31:24 Be strong , and let your heart take courage , all you who hope in Yahweh . 


$ 18:32:1 Blessed is he whose disobedience is forgiven , whose sin is covered . 

$ 18:32:2 Blessed is the man to whom Yahweh doesn't impute iniquity , in whose spirit there is no deceit . 

$ 18:32:3 When I kept silence , my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long . 

$ 18:32:4 For day and night your hand was heavy on me . My strength was sapped in the heat of summer . Selah . 

$ 18:32:5 I acknowledged my sin to you . I didn't hide my iniquity . I said , I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh , and you forgave the iniquity of my sin . Selah . 

$ 18:32:6 For this , let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found . Surely when the great waters overflow , they shall not reach to him . 

$ 18:32:7 You are my hiding place . You will preserve me from trouble . You will surround me with songs of deliverance . Selah . 

$ 18:32:8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go . I will counsel you with my eye on you . 

$ 18:32:9 Don't be like the horse , or like the mule , which have no understanding , who are controlled by bit and bridle , or else they will not come near to you . 

$ 18:32:10 Many sorrows come to the wicked , but loving kindness shall surround him who trusts in Yahweh . 

$ 18:32:11 Be glad in Yahweh , and rejoice , you righteous ! Shout for joy , all you who are upright in heart ! 


$ 18:33:1 Rejoice in Yahweh , you righteous ! Praise is fitting for the upright . 

$ 18:33:2 Give thanks to Yahweh with the lyre . Sing praises to him with the harp of ten strings . 

$ 18:33:3 Sing to him a new song . Play skillfully with a shout of joy ! 

$ 18:33:4 For Yahweh's word is right . All his work is done in faithfulness . 

$ 18:33:5 He loves righteousness and justice . The earth is full of the loving kindness of Yahweh . 

$ 18:33:6 By Yahweh's word , the heavens were made ; all their army by the breath of his mouth . 

$ 18:33:7 He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap . He lays up the deeps in storehouses . 

$ 18:33:8 Let all the earth fear Yahweh . Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him . 

$ 18:33:9 For he spoke , and it was done . He commanded , and it stood firm . 

$ 18:33:10 Yahweh brings the counsel of the nations to nothing . He makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect . 

$ 18:33:11 The counsel of Yahweh stands fast forever , the thoughts of his heart to all generations . 

$ 18:33:12 Blessed is the nation whose God is Yahweh , the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance . 

$ 18:33:13 Yahweh looks from heaven . He sees all the sons of men . 

$ 18:33:14 From the place of his habitation he looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth , 

$ 18:33:15 he who fashions all of their hearts ; and he considers all of their works . 

$ 18:33:16 There is no king saved by the multitude of an army . A mighty man is not delivered by great strength . 

$ 18:33:17 A horse is a vain thing for safety , neither does he deliver any by his great power . 

$ 18:33:18 Behold , Yahweh's eye is on those who fear him , on those who hope in his loving kindness ; 

$ 18:33:19 to deliver their soul from death , to keep them alive in famine . 

$ 18:33:20 Our soul has waited for Yahweh . He is our help and our shield . 

$ 18:33:21 For our heart rejoices in him , because we have trusted in his holy name . 

$ 18:33:22 Let your loving kindness be on us , Yahweh , since we have hoped in you . 


$ 18:34:1 I will bless Yahweh at all times . His praise will always be in my mouth . 

$ 18:34:2 My soul shall boast in Yahweh . The humble shall hear of it , and be glad . 

$ 18:34:3 Oh magnify Yahweh with me . Let's exalt his name together . 

$ 18:34:4 I sought Yahweh , and he answered me , and delivered me from all my fears . 

$ 18:34:5 They looked to him , and were radiant . Their faces shall never be covered with shame . 

$ 18:34:6 This poor man cried , and Yahweh heard him , and saved him out of all his troubles . 

$ 18:34:7 Yahweh's angel encamps around those who fear him , and delivers them . 

$ 18:34:8 Oh taste and see that Yahweh is good . Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him . 

$ 18:34:9 Oh fear Yahweh , you his saints , for there is no lack with those who fear him . 

$ 18:34:10 The young lions do lack , and suffer hunger , but those who seek Yahweh shall not lack any good thing . 

$ 18:34:11 Come , you children , listen to me . I will teach you the fear of Yahweh . 

$ 18:34:12 Who is someone who desires life , and loves many days , that he may see good ? 

$ 18:34:13 Keep your tongue from evil , and your lips from speaking lies . 

$ 18:34:14 Depart from evil , and do good . Seek peace , and pursue it . 

$ 18:34:15 Yahweh's eyes are toward the righteous . His ears listen to their cry . 

$ 18:34:16 Yahweh's face is against those who do evil , to cut off their memory from the earth . 

$ 18:34:17 The righteous cry , and Yahweh hears , and delivers them out of all their troubles . 

$ 18:34:18 Yahweh is near to those who have a broken heart , and saves those who have a crushed spirit . 

$ 18:34:19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous , but Yahweh delivers him out of them all . 

$ 18:34:20 He protects all of his bones . Not one of them is broken . 

$ 18:34:21 Evil shall kill the wicked . Those who hate the righteous shall be condemned . 

$ 18:34:22 Yahweh redeems the soul of his servants . None of those who take refuge in him shall be condemned . 


$ 18:35:1 Contend , Yahweh , with those who contend with me . Fight against those who fight against me . 

$ 18:35:2 Take hold of shield and buckler , and stand up for my help . 

$ 18:35:3 Brandish the spear and block those who pursue me . Tell my soul , <" I am your salvation . >" 

$ 18:35:4 Let those who seek after my soul be disappointed and brought to dishonor . Let those who plot my ruin be turned back and confounded . 

$ 18:35:5 Let them be as chaff before the wind , Yahweh's angel driving them on . 

$ 18:35:6 Let their way be dark and slippery , Yahweh's angel pursuing them . 

$ 18:35:7 For without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for me . Without cause they have dug a pit for my soul . 

$ 18:35:8 Let destruction come on him unawares . Let his net that he has hidden catch himself . Let him fall into that destruction . 

$ 18:35:9 My soul shall be joyful in Yahweh . It shall rejoice in his salvation . 

$ 18:35:10 All my bones shall say , <" Yahweh , who is like you , who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him ; yes , the poor and the needy from him who robs him ? >" 

$ 18:35:11 Unrighteous witnesses rise up . They ask me about things that I don't know about . 

$ 18:35:12 They reward me evil for good , to the bereaving of my soul . 

$ 18:35:13 But as for me , when they were sick , my clothing was sackcloth . I afflicted my soul with fasting . My prayer returned into my own bosom . 

$ 18:35:14 I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother . I bowed down mourning , as one who mourns his mother . 

$ 18:35:15 But in my adversity , they rejoiced , and gathered themselves together . The attackers gathered themselves together against me , and I didn't know it . They tore at me , and didn't cease . 

$ 18:35:16 Like the profane mockers in feasts , they gnashed their teeth at me . 

$ 18:35:17 Lord , how long will you look on ? Rescue my soul from their destruction , my precious life from the lions . 

$ 18:35:18 I will give you thanks in the great assembly . I will praise you among many people . 

$ 18:35:19 Don't let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me ; neither let those who hate me without a cause wink their eyes . 

$ 18:35:20 For they don't speak peace , but they devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land . 

$ 18:35:21 Yes , they opened their mouth wide against me . They said , <" Aha ! Aha ! Our eye has seen it ! >" 

$ 18:35:22 You have seen it , Yahweh . Don't keep silent . Lord , don't be far from me . 

$ 18:35:23 Wake up ! Rise up to defend me , my God ! My Lord , contend for me ! 

$ 18:35:24 Vindicate me , Yahweh my God , according to your righteousness . Don't let them gloat over me . 

$ 18:35:25 Don't let them say in their heart , <" Aha ! That's the way we want it ! >" Don't let them say , <" We have swallowed him up ! >" 

$ 18:35:26 Let them be disappointed and confounded together who rejoice at my calamity . Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves against me . 

$ 18:35:27 Let them shout for joy and be glad , who favor my righteous cause . Yes , let them say continually , <" Yahweh be magnified , who has pleasure in the prosperity of his servant ! >" 

$ 18:35:28 My tongue shall talk about your righteousness and about your praise all day long . 


$ 18:36:1 A revelation is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked : <" There is no fear of God before his eyes . >" 

$ 18:36:2 For he flatters himself in his own eyes , too much to detect and hate his sin . 

$ 18:36:3 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit . He has ceased to be wise and to do good . 

$ 18:36:4 He plots iniquity on his bed . He sets himself in a way that is not good . He doesn't abhor evil . 

$ 18:36:5 Your loving kindness , Yahweh , is in the heavens . Your faithfulness reaches to the skies . 

$ 18:36:6 Your righteousness is like the mountains of God . Your judgments are like a great deep . Yahweh , you preserve man and animal . 

$ 18:36:7 How precious is your loving kindness , God ! The children of men take refuge under the shadow of your wings . 

$ 18:36:8 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house . You will make them drink of the river of your pleasures . 

$ 18:36:9 For with you is the spring of life . In your light we will see light . 

$ 18:36:10 Oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you , your righteousness to the upright in heart . 

$ 18:36:11 Don't let the foot of pride come against me . Don't let the hand of the wicked drive me away . 

$ 18:36:12 There the workers of iniquity are fallen . They are thrust down , and shall not be able to rise . 


$ 18:37:1 Don't fret because of evildoers , neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness . 

$ 18:37:2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass , and wither like the green herb . 

$ 18:37:3 Trust in Yahweh , and do good . Dwell in the land , and enjoy safe pasture . 

$ 18:37:4 Also delight yourself in Yahweh , and he will give you the desires of your heart . 

$ 18:37:5 Commit your way to Yahweh . Trust also in him , and he will do this : 

$ 18:37:6 he will make your righteousness go out as the light , and your justice as the noon day sun . 

$ 18:37:7 Rest in Yahweh , and wait patiently for him . Don't fret because of him who prospers in his way , because of the man who makes wicked plots happen . 

$ 18:37:8 Cease from anger , and forsake wrath . Don't fret , it leads only to evildoing . 

$ 18:37:9 For evildoers shall be cut off , but those who wait for Yahweh shall inherit the land . 

$ 18:37:10 For yet a little while , and the wicked will be no more . Yes , though you look for his place , he isn't there . 

$ 18:37:11 But the humble shall inherit the land , and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace . 

$ 18:37:12 The wicked plots against the just , and gnashes at him with his teeth . 

$ 18:37:13 The Lord will laugh at him , for he sees that his day is coming . 

$ 18:37:14 The wicked have drawn out the sword , and have bent their bow , to cast down the poor and needy , to kill those who are upright on the path . 

$ 18:37:15 Their sword shall enter into their own heart . Their bows shall be broken . 

$ 18:37:16 Better is a little that the righteous has , than the abundance of many wicked . 

$ 18:37:17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken , but Yahweh upholds the righteous . 

$ 18:37:18 Yahweh knows the days of the perfect . Their inheritance shall be forever . 

$ 18:37:19 They shall not be disappointed in the time of evil . In the days of famine they shall be satisfied . 

$ 18:37:20 But the wicked shall perish . The enemies of Yahweh shall be like the beauty of the fields . They will vanish - vanish like smoke . 

$ 18:37:21 The wicked borrow , and don't pay back , but the righteous give generously . 

$ 18:37:22 For such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land . Those who are cursed by him shall be cut off . 

$ 18:37:23 A man's goings are established by Yahweh . He delights in his way . 

$ 18:37:24 Though he stumble , he shall not fall , for Yahweh holds him up with his hand . 

$ 18:37:25 I have been young , and now am old , yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken , nor his children begging for bread . 

$ 18:37:26 All day long he deals graciously , and lends . His offspring is blessed . 

$ 18:37:27 Depart from evil , and do good . Live securely forever . 

$ 18:37:28 For Yahweh loves justice , and doesn't forsake his saints . They are preserved forever , but the children of the wicked shall be cut off . 

$ 18:37:29 The righteous shall inherit the land , and live in it forever . 

$ 18:37:30 The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom . His tongue speaks justice . 

$ 18:37:31 The law of his God is in his heart . None of his steps shall slide . 

$ 18:37:32 The wicked watches the righteous , and seeks to kill him . 

$ 18:37:33 Yahweh will not leave him in his hand , nor condemn him when he is judged . 

$ 18:37:34 Wait for Yahweh , and keep his way , and he will exalt you to inherit the land . When the wicked are cut off , you shall see it . 

$ 18:37:35 I have seen the wicked in great power , spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil . 

$ 18:37:36 But he passed away , and behold , he was not . Yes , I sought him , but he could not be found . 

$ 18:37:37 Mark the perfect man , and see the upright , for there is a future for the man of peace . 

$ 18:37:38 As for transgressors , they shall be destroyed together . The future of the wicked shall be cut off . 

$ 18:37:39 But the salvation of the righteous is from Yahweh . He is their stronghold in the time of trouble . 

$ 18:37:40 Yahweh helps them , and rescues them . He rescues them from the wicked , and saves them , because they have taken refuge in him . 


$ 18:38:1 Yahweh , don't rebuke me in your wrath , neither chasten me in your hot displeasure . 

$ 18:38:2 For your arrows have pierced me , your hand presses hard on me . 

$ 18:38:3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation , neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin . 

$ 18:38:4 For my iniquities have gone over my head . As a heavy burden , they are too heavy for me . 

$ 18:38:5 My wounds are loathsome and corrupt , because of my foolishness . 

$ 18:38:6 I am pained and bowed down greatly . I go mourning all day long . 

$ 18:38:7 For my waist is filled with burning . There is no soundness in my flesh . 

$ 18:38:8 I am faint and severely bruised . I have groaned by reason of the anguish of my heart . 

$ 18:38:9 Lord , all my desire is before you . My groaning is not hidden from you . 

$ 18:38:10 My heart throbs . My strength fails me . As for the light of my eyes , it has also left me . 

$ 18:38:11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague . My kinsmen stand far away . 

$ 18:38:12 They also who seek after my life lay snares . Those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things , and meditate deceits all day long . 

$ 18:38:13 But I , as a deaf man , don't hear . I am as a mute man who doesn't open his mouth . 

$ 18:38:14 Yes , I am as a man who doesn't hear , in whose mouth are no reproofs . 

$ 18:38:15 For in you , Yahweh , do I hope . You will answer , Lord my God . 

$ 18:38:16 For I said , <" Don't let them gloat over me , or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips . >" 

$ 18:38:17 For I am ready to fall . My pain is continually before me . 

$ 18:38:18 For I will declare my iniquity . I will be sorry for my sin . 

$ 18:38:19 But my enemies are vigorous and many . Those who hate me without reason are numerous . 

$ 18:38:20 They who render evil for good are also adversaries to me , because I follow what is good . 

$ 18:38:21 Don't forsake me , Yahweh . My God , don't be far from me . 

$ 18:38:22 Hurry to help me , Lord , my salvation . 


$ 18:39:1 I said , <" I will watch my ways , so that I don't sin with my tongue . I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me . >" 

$ 18:39:2 I was mute with silence . I held my peace , even from good . My sorrow was stirred . 

$ 18:39:3 My heart was hot within me . While I meditated , the fire burned . I spoke with my tongue : 

$ 18:39:4 <" Yahweh , show me my end , what is the measure of my days . Let me know how frail I am . 

$ 18:39:5 Behold , you have made my days hand widths . My lifetime is as nothing before you . Surely every man stands as a breath . >" Selah . 

$ 18:39:6 <" Surely every man walks like a shadow . Surely they busy themselves in vain . He heaps up , and doesn't know who shall gather . 

$ 18:39:7 Now , Lord , what do I wait for ? My hope is in you . 

$ 18:39:8 Deliver me from all my transgressions . Don't make me the reproach of the foolish . 

$ 18:39:9 I was mute . I didn't open my mouth , because you did it . 

$ 18:39:10 Remove your scourge away from me . I am overcome by the blow of your hand . 

$ 18:39:11 When you rebuke and correct man for iniquity , you consume his wealth like a moth . Surely every man is but a breath . >" Selah . 

$ 18:39:12 <" Hear my prayer , Yahweh , and give ear to my cry . Don't be silent at my tears . For I am a stranger with you , a foreigner , as all my fathers were . 

$ 18:39:13 Oh spare me , that I may recover strength , before I go away , and exist no more . >" 


$ 18:40:1 I waited patiently for Yahweh . He turned to me , and heard my cry . 

$ 18:40:2 He brought me up also out of a horrible pit , out of the miry clay . He set my feet on a rock , and gave me a firm place to stand . 

$ 18:40:3 He has put a new song in my mouth , even praise to our God . Many shall see it , and fear , and shall trust in Yahweh . 

$ 18:40:4 Blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his trust , and doesn't respect the proud , nor such as turn away to lies . 

$ 18:40:5 Many , Yahweh , my God , are the wonderful works which you have done , and your thoughts which are toward us . They can't be declared back to you . If I would declare and speak of them , they are more than can be counted . 

$ 18:40:6 Sacrifice and offering you didn't desire . You have opened my ears . You have not required burnt offering and sin offering . 

$ 18:40:7 Then I said , <" Behold , I have come . It is written about me in the book in the scroll . 

$ 18:40:8 I delight to do your will , my God . Yes , your law is within my heart . >" 

$ 18:40:9 I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly . Behold , I will not seal my lips , Yahweh , you know . 

$ 18:40:10 I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart . I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation . I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great assembly . 

$ 18:40:11 Don't withhold your tender mercies from me , Yahweh . Let your loving kindness and your truth continually preserve me . 

$ 18:40:12 For innumerable evils have surrounded me . My iniquities have overtaken me , so that I am not able to look up . They are more than the hairs of my head . My heart has failed me . 

$ 18:40:13 Be pleased , Yahweh , to deliver me . Hurry to help me , Yahweh . 

$ 18:40:14 Let them be disappointed and confounded together who seek after my soul to destroy it . Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt . 

$ 18:40:15 Let them be desolate by reason of their shame that tell me , <" Aha ! Aha ! >" 

$ 18:40:16 Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you . Let such as love your salvation say continually , <" Let Yahweh be exalted ! >" 

$ 18:40:17 But I am poor and needy . May the Lord think about me . You are my help and my deliverer . Don't delay , my God . 


$ 18:41:1 Blessed is he who considers the poor . Yahweh will deliver him in the day of evil . 

$ 18:41:2 Yahweh will preserve him , and keep him alive . He shall be blessed on the earth , and he will not surrender him to the will of his enemies . 

$ 18:41:3 Yahweh will sustain him on his sickbed , and restore him from his bed of illness . 

$ 18:41:4 I said , <" Yahweh , have mercy on me ! Heal me , for I have sinned against you . >" 

$ 18:41:5 My enemies speak evil against me : <" When will he die , and his name perish ? >" 

$ 18:41:6 If he comes to see me , he speaks falsehood . His heart gathers iniquity to itself . When he goes abroad , he tells it . 

$ 18:41:7 All who hate me whisper together against me . They imagine the worst for me . 

$ 18:41:8 <" An evil disease >" , they say , <" has afflicted him . Now that he lies he shall rise up no more . >" 

$ 18:41:9 Yes , my own familiar friend , in whom I trusted , who ate bread with me , has lifted up his heel against me . 

$ 18:41:10 But you , Yahweh , have mercy on me , and raise me up , that I may repay them . 

$ 18:41:11 By this I know that you delight in me , because my enemy doesn't triumph over me . 

$ 18:41:12 As for me , you uphold me in my integrity , and set me in your presence forever . 

$ 18:41:13 Blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , from everlasting and to everlasting ! Amen and amen . 


$ 18:42:1 As the deer pants for the water brooks , so my soul pants after you , God . 

$ 18:42:2 My soul thirsts for God , for the living God . When shall I come and appear before God ? 

$ 18:42:3 My tears have been my food day and night , while they continually ask me , <" Where is your God ? >" 

$ 18:42:4 These things I remember , and pour out my soul within me , how I used to go with the crowd , and led them to God's house , with the voice of joy and praise , a multitude keeping a holy day . 

$ 18:42:5 Why are you in despair , my soul ? Why are you disturbed within me ? Hope in God ! For I shall still praise him for the saving help of his presence . 

$ 18:42:6 My God , my soul is in despair within me . Therefore I remember you from the land of the Jordan , the heights of Hermon , from the hill Mizar . 

$ 18:42:7 Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls . All your waves and your billows have swept over me . 

$ 18:42:8 Yahweh will command his loving kindness in the daytime . In the night his song shall be with me : a prayer to the God of my life . 

$ 18:42:9 I will ask God , my rock , <" Why have you forgotten me ? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy ? >" 

$ 18:42:10 As with a sword in my bones , my adversaries reproach me , while they continually ask me , <" Where is your God ? >" 

$ 18:42:11 Why are you in despair , my soul ? Why are you disturbed within me ? Hope in God ! For I shall still praise him , the saving help of my countenance , and my God . 


$ 18:43:1 Vindicate me , God , and plead my cause against an ungodly nation . Oh , deliver me from deceitful and wicked men . 

$ 18:43:2 For you are the God of my strength . Why have you rejected me ? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy ? 

$ 18:43:3 Oh , send out your light and your truth . Let them lead me . Let them bring me to your holy hill , To your tents . 

$ 18:43:4 Then I will go to the altar of God , to God , my exceeding joy . I will praise you on the harp , God , my God . 

$ 18:43:5 Why are you in despair , my soul ? Why are you disturbed within me ? Hope in God ! For I shall still praise him : my Savior , my helper , and my God . 


$ 18:44:1 We have heard with our ears , God ; our fathers have told us , what work you did in their days , in the days of old . 

$ 18:44:2 You drove out the nations with your hand , but you planted them . You afflicted the peoples , but you spread them abroad . 

$ 18:44:3 For they didn't get the land in possession by their own sword , neither did their own arm save them ; but your right hand , and your arm , and the light of your face , because you were favorable to them . 

$ 18:44:4 You are my King , God . Command victories for Jacob ! 

$ 18:44:5 Through you , will we push down our adversaries . Through your name , we will tread them under who rise up against us . 

$ 18:44:6 For I will not trust in my bow , neither shall my sword save me . 

$ 18:44:7 But you have saved us from our adversaries , and have shamed those who hate us . 

$ 18:44:8 In God we have made our boast all day long , we will give thanks to your name forever . Selah . 

$ 18:44:9 But now you rejected us , and brought us to dishonor , and don't go out with our armies . 

$ 18:44:10 You make us turn back from the adversary . Those who hate us take plunder for themselves . 

$ 18:44:11 You have made us like sheep for food , and have scattered us among the nations . 

$ 18:44:12 You sell your people for nothing , and have gained nothing from their sale . 

$ 18:44:13 You make us a reproach to our neighbors , a scoffing and a derision to those who are around us . 

$ 18:44:14 You make us a byword among the nations , a shaking of the head among the peoples . 

$ 18:44:15 All day long my dishonor is before me , and shame covers my face , 

$ 18:44:16 At the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses , because of the enemy and the avenger . 

$ 18:44:17 All this has come on us , yet we haven't forgotten you . We haven't been false to your covenant . 

$ 18:44:18 Our heart has not turned back , neither have our steps strayed from your path , 

$ 18:44:19 Though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals , and covered us with the shadow of death . 

$ 18:44:20 If we have forgotten the name of our God , or spread out our hands to a strange god ; 

$ 18:44:21 won't God search this out ? For he knows the secrets of the heart . 

$ 18:44:22 Yes , for your sake we are killed all day long . We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter . 

$ 18:44:23 Wake up ! Why do you sleep , Lord ? Arise ! Don't reject us forever . 

$ 18:44:24 Why do you hide your face , and forget our affliction and our oppression ? 

$ 18:44:25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust . Our body clings to the earth . 

$ 18:44:26 Rise up to help us . Redeem us for your loving kindness' sake . 


$ 18:45:1 My heart overflows with a noble theme . I recite my verses for the king . My tongue is like the pen of a skillful writer . 

$ 18:45:2 You are the most excellent of the sons of men . Grace has anointed your lips , therefore God has blessed you forever . 

$ 18:45:3 Strap your sword on your thigh , mighty one : your splendor and your majesty . 

$ 18:45:4 In your majesty ride on victoriously on behalf of truth , humility , and righteousness . Let your right hand display awesome deeds . 

$ 18:45:5 Your arrows are sharp . The nations fall under you , with arrows in the heart of the king's enemies . 

$ 18:45:6 Your throne , God , is forever and ever . A scepter of equity is the scepter of your kingdom . 

$ 18:45:7 You have loved righteousness , and hated wickedness . Therefore God , your God , has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows . 

$ 18:45:8 All your garments smell like myrrh , aloes , and cassia . Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad . 

$ 18:45:9 Kings' daughters are among your honorable women . At your right hand the queen stands in gold of Ophir . 

$ 18:45:10 Listen , daughter , consider , and turn your ear . Forget your own people , and also your father's house . 

$ 18:45:11 So the king will desire your beauty , honor him , for he is your lord . 

$ 18:45:12 The daughter of Tyre comes with a gift . The rich among the people entreat your favor . 

$ 18:45:13 The princess inside is all glorious . Her clothing is interwoven with gold . 

$ 18:45:14 She shall be led to the king in embroidered work . The virgins , her companions who follow her , shall be brought to you . 

$ 18:45:15 With gladness and rejoicing they shall be led . They shall enter into the king's palace . 

$ 18:45:16 Your sons will take the place of your fathers . You shall make them princes in all the earth . 

$ 18:45:17 I will make your name to be remembered in all generations . Therefore the peoples shall give you thanks forever and ever . 


$ 18:46:1 God is our refuge and strength , a very present help in trouble . 

$ 18:46:2 Therefore we won't be afraid , though the earth changes , though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the seas ; 

$ 18:46:3 though its waters roar and are troubled , though the mountains tremble with their swelling . Selah . 

$ 18:46:4 There is a river , the streams of which make the city of God glad , the holy place of the tents of the Most High . 

$ 18:46:5 God is within her . She shall not be moved . God will help her at dawn . 

$ 18:46:6 The nations raged . The kingdoms were moved . He lifted his voice , and the earth melted . 

$ 18:46:7 Yahweh of Armies is with us . The God of Jacob is our refuge . Selah . 

$ 18:46:8 Come , see Yahweh's works , what desolations he has made in the earth . 

$ 18:46:9 He makes wars cease to the end of the earth . He breaks the bow , and shatters the spear . He burns the chariots in the fire . 

$ 18:46:10 <" Be still , and know that I am God . I will be exalted among the nations . I will be exalted in the earth . >" 

$ 18:46:11 Yahweh of Armies is with us . The God of Jacob is our refuge . Selah . 


$ 18:47:1 Oh clap your hands , all you nations . Shout to God with the voice of triumph ! 

$ 18:47:2 For Yahweh Most High is awesome . He is a great King over all the earth . 

$ 18:47:3 He subdues nations under us , and peoples under our feet . 

$ 18:47:4 He chooses our inheritance for us , the glory of Jacob whom he loved . Selah . 

$ 18:47:5 God has gone up with a shout , Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet . 

$ 18:47:6 Sing praises to God , sing praises . Sing praises to our King , sing praises . 

$ 18:47:7 For God is the King of all the earth . Sing praises with understanding . 

$ 18:47:8 God reigns over the nations . God sits on his holy throne . 

$ 18:47:9 The princes of the peoples are gathered together , the people of the God of Abraham . For the shields of the earth belong to God . He is greatly exalted ! 


$ 18:48:1 Great is Yahweh , and greatly to be praised , in the city of our God , in his holy mountain . 

$ 18:48:2 Beautiful in elevation , the joy of the whole earth , is Mount Zion , on the north sides , the city of the great King . 

$ 18:48:3 God has shown himself in her citadels as a refuge . 

$ 18:48:4 For , behold , the kings assembled themselves , they passed by together . 

$ 18:48:5 They saw it , then they were amazed . They were dismayed . They hurried away . 

$ 18:48:6 Trembling took hold of them there , pain , as of a woman in travail . 

$ 18:48:7 With the east wind , you break the ships of Tarshish . 

$ 18:48:8 As we have heard , so we have seen , in the city of Yahweh of Armies , in the city of our God . God will establish it forever . Selah . 

$ 18:48:9 We have thought about your loving kindness , God , in the middle of your temple . 

$ 18:48:10 As is your name , God , so is your praise to the ends of the earth . Your right hand is full of righteousness . 

$ 18:48:11 Let Mount Zion be glad ! Let the daughters of Judah rejoice , Because of your judgments . 

$ 18:48:12 Walk about Zion , and go around her . Number its towers . 

$ 18:48:13 Mark well her bulwarks . Consider her palaces , that you may tell it to the next generation . 

$ 18:48:14 For this God is our God forever and ever . He will be our guide even to death . 


$ 18:49:1 Hear this , all you peoples . Listen , all you inhabitants of the world , 

$ 18:49:2 both low and high , rich and poor together . 

$ 18:49:3 My mouth will speak words of wisdom . My heart shall utter understanding . 

$ 18:49:4 I will incline my ear to a proverb . I will open my riddle on the harp . 

$ 18:49:5 Why should I fear in the days of evil , when iniquity at my heels surrounds me ? 

$ 18:49:6 Those who trust in their wealth , and boast in the multitude of their riches - 

$ 18:49:7 none of them can by any means redeem his brother , nor give God a ransom for him . 

$ 18:49:8 For the redemption of their life is costly , no payment is ever enough , 

$ 18:49:9 that he should live on forever , that he should not see corruption . 

$ 18:49:10 For he sees that wise men die ; likewise the fool and the senseless perish , and leave their wealth to others . 

$ 18:49:11 Their inward thought is that their houses will endure forever , and their dwelling places to all generations . They name their lands after themselves . 

$ 18:49:12 But man , despite his riches , doesn't endure . He is like the animals that perish . 

$ 18:49:13 This is the destiny of those who are foolish , and of those who approve their sayings . Selah . 

$ 18:49:14 They are appointed as a flock for Sheol . Death shall be their shepherd . The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning . Their beauty shall decay in Sheol , far from their mansion . 

$ 18:49:15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol , for he will receive me . Selah . 

$ 18:49:16 Don't be afraid when a man is made rich , when the glory of his house is increased ; 

$ 18:49:17 for when he dies he will carry nothing away . His glory won't descend after him . 

$ 18:49:18 Though while he lived he blessed his soul - and men praise you when you do well for yourself - 

$ 18:49:19 he shall go to the generation of his fathers . They shall never see the light . 

$ 18:49:20 A man who has riches without understanding , is like the animals that perish . 


$ 18:50:1 The Mighty One , God , Yahweh , speaks , and calls the earth from sunrise to sunset . 

$ 18:50:2 Out of Zion , the perfection of beauty , God shines out . 

$ 18:50:3 Our God comes , and does not keep silent . A fire devours before him . It is very stormy around him . 

$ 18:50:4 He calls to the heavens above , to the earth , that he may judge his people : 

$ 18:50:5 <" Gather my saints together to me , those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice . >" 

$ 18:50:6 The heavens shall declare his righteousness , for God himself is judge . Selah . 

$ 18:50:7 <" Hear , my people , and I will speak ; Israel , and I will testify against you . I am God , your God . 

$ 18:50:8 I don't rebuke you for your sacrifices . Your burnt offerings are continually before me . 

$ 18:50:9 I have no need for a bull from your stall , nor male goats from your pens . 

$ 18:50:10 For every animal of the forest is mine , and the livestock on a thousand hills . 

$ 18:50:11 I know all the birds of the mountains . The wild animals of the field are mine . 

$ 18:50:12 If I were hungry , I would not tell you , for the world is mine , and all that is in it . 

$ 18:50:13 Will I eat the meat of bulls , or drink the blood of goats ? 

$ 18:50:14 Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving . Pay your vows to the Most High . 

$ 18:50:15 Call on me in the day of trouble . I will deliver you , and you will honor me . >" 

$ 18:50:16 But to the wicked God says , <" What right do you have to declare my statutes , that you have taken my covenant on your lips , 

$ 18:50:17 since you hate instruction , and throw my words behind you ? 

$ 18:50:18 When you saw a thief , you consented with him , and have participated with adulterers . 

$ 18:50:19 <" You give your mouth to evil . Your tongue frames deceit . 

$ 18:50:20 You sit and speak against your brother . You slander your own mother's son . 

$ 18:50:21 You have done these things , and I kept silent . You thought that I was just like you . I will rebuke you , and accuse you in front of your eyes . 

$ 18:50:22 <" Now consider this , you who forget God , lest I tear you into pieces , and there be no one to deliver . 

$ 18:50:23 Whoever offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me , and prepares his way so that I will show God's salvation to him . >" 


$ 18:51:1 Have mercy on me , God , according to your loving kindness . According to the multitude of your tender mercies , blot out my transgressions . 

$ 18:51:2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity . Cleanse me from my sin . 

$ 18:51:3 For I know my transgressions . My sin is constantly before me . 

$ 18:51:4 Against you , and you only , I have sinned , and done that which is evil in your sight ; that you may be proved right when you speak , and justified when you judge . 

$ 18:51:5 Behold , I was born in iniquity . In sin my mother conceived me . 

$ 18:51:6 Behold , you desire truth in the inward parts . You teach me wisdom in the inmost place . 

$ 18:51:7 Purify me with hyssop , and I will be clean . Wash me , and I will be whiter than snow . 

$ 18:51:8 Let me hear joy and gladness , That the bones which you have broken may rejoice . 

$ 18:51:9 Hide your face from my sins , and blot out all of my iniquities . 

$ 18:51:10 Create in me a clean heart , O God . Renew a right spirit within me . 

$ 18:51:11 Don't throw me from your presence , and don't take your holy Spirit from me . 

$ 18:51:12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation . Uphold me with a willing spirit . 

$ 18:51:13 Then I will teach transgressors your ways . Sinners shall be converted to you . 

$ 18:51:14 Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed , O God , the God of my salvation . My tongue shall sing aloud of your righteousness . 

$ 18:51:15 Lord , open my lips . My mouth shall declare your praise . 

$ 18:51:16 For you don't delight in sacrifice , or else I would give it . You have no pleasure in burnt offering . 

$ 18:51:17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit . A broken and contrite heart , O God , you will not despise . 

$ 18:51:18 Do well in your good pleasure to Zion . Build the walls of Jerusalem . 

$ 18:51:19 Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness , in burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings . Then they will offer bulls on your altar .

$ 18:52:1 Why do you boast of mischief , mighty man ? God's loving kindness endures continually . 

$ 18:52:2 Your tongue plots destruction , like a sharp razor , working deceitfully . 

$ 18:52:3 You love evil more than good , lying rather than speaking the truth . Selah . 

$ 18:52:4 You love all devouring words , you deceitful tongue . 

$ 18:52:5 God will likewise destroy you forever . He will take you up , and pluck you out of your tent , and root you out of the land of the living . Selah . 

$ 18:52:6 The righteous also will see it , and fear , and laugh at him , saying , 

$ 18:52:7 <" Behold , this is the man who didn't make God his strength , but trusted in the abundance of his riches , and strengthened himself in his wickedness . >" 

$ 18:52:8 But as for me , I am like a green olive tree in God's house . I trust in God's loving kindness forever and ever . 

$ 18:52:9 I will give you thanks forever , because you have done it . I will hope in your name , for it is good , in the presence of your saints . 


$ 18:53:1 The fool has said in his heart , <" There is no God . >" They are corrupt , and have done abominable iniquity . There is no one who does good . 

$ 18:53:2 God looks down from heaven on the children of men , to see if there are any who understood , who seek after God . 

$ 18:53:3 Every one of them has gone back . They have become filthy together . There is no one who does good , no , not one . 

$ 18:53:4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge , who eat up my people as they eat bread , and don't call on God ? 

$ 18:53:5 There they were in great fear , where no fear was , for God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you . You have put them to shame , because God has rejected them . 

$ 18:53:6 Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion ! When God brings back his people from captivity , then Jacob shall rejoice , and Israel shall be glad .

$ 18:54:1 Save me , God , by your name . Vindicate me in your might . 

$ 18:54:2 Hear my prayer , God . Listen to the words of my mouth . 

$ 18:54:3 For strangers have risen up against me . Violent men have sought after my soul . They haven't set God before them . Selah . 

$ 18:54:4 Behold , God is my helper . The Lord is the one who sustains my soul . 

$ 18:54:5 He will repay the evil to my enemies . Destroy them in your truth . 

$ 18:54:6 With a free will offering , I will sacrifice to you . I will give thanks to your name , Yahweh , for it is good . 

$ 18:54:7 For he has delivered me out of all trouble . My eye has seen triumph over my enemies . 


$ 18:55:1 Listen to my prayer , God . Don't hide yourself from my supplication . 

$ 18:55:2 Attend to me , and answer me . I am restless in my complaint , and moan , 

$ 18:55:3 Because of the voice of the enemy , Because of the oppression of the wicked . For they bring suffering on me . In anger they hold a grudge against me . 

$ 18:55:4 My heart is severely pained within me . The terrors of death have fallen on me . 

$ 18:55:5 Fearfulness and trembling have come on me . Horror has overwhelmed me . 

$ 18:55:6 I said , <" Oh that I had wings like a dove ! Then I would fly away , and be at rest . 

$ 18:55:7 Behold , then I would wander far off . I would lodge in the wilderness . >" Selah . 

$ 18:55:8 <" I would hurry to a shelter from the stormy wind and storm . >" 

$ 18:55:9 Confuse them , Lord , and confound their language , for I have seen violence and strife in the city . 

$ 18:55:10 Day and night they prowl around on its walls . Malice and abuse are also within her . 

$ 18:55:11 Destructive forces are within her . Threats and lies don't depart from her streets . 

$ 18:55:12 For it was not an enemy who insulted me , then I could have endured it . Neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me , then I would have hidden myself from him . 

$ 18:55:13 But it was you , a man like me , my companion , and my familiar friend . 

$ 18:55:14 We took sweet fellowship together . We walked in God's house with company . 

$ 18:55:15 Let death come suddenly on them . Let them go down alive into Sheol . For wickedness is among them , in their dwelling . 

$ 18:55:16 As for me , I will call on God . Yahweh will save me . 

$ 18:55:17 Evening , morning , and at noon , I will cry out in distress . He will hear my voice . 

$ 18:55:18 He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me , although there are many who oppose me . 

$ 18:55:19 God , who is enthroned forever , will hear , and answer them . Selah . They never change , who don't fear God . 

$ 18:55:20 He raises his hands against his friends . He has violated his covenant . 

$ 18:55:21 His mouth was smooth as butter , but his heart was war . His words were softer than oil , yet they were drawn swords . 

$ 18:55:22 Cast your burden on Yahweh , and he will sustain you . He will never allow the righteous to be moved . 

$ 18:55:23 But you , God , will bring them down into the pit of destruction . Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days , but I will trust in you . 
Gath . 

$ 18:56:1 Be merciful to me , God , for man wants to swallow me up . All day long , he attacks and oppresses me . 

$ 18:56:2 My enemies want to swallow me up all day long , for they are many who fight proudly against me . 

$ 18:56:3 When I am afraid , I will put my trust in you . 

$ 18:56:4 In God , I praise his word . In God , I put my trust . I will not be afraid . What can flesh do to me ? 

$ 18:56:5 All day long they twist my words . All their thoughts are against me for evil . 

$ 18:56:6 They conspire and lurk , watching my steps , they are eager to take my life . 

$ 18:56:7 Shall they escape by iniquity ? In anger cast down the peoples , God . 

$ 18:56:8 You count my wanderings . You put my tears into your container . Aren't they in your book ? 

$ 18:56:9 Then my enemies shall turn back in the day that I call . I know this , that God is for me . 

$ 18:56:10 In God , I will praise his word . In Yahweh , I will praise his word . 

$ 18:56:11 I have put my trust in God . I will not be afraid . What can man do to me ? 

$ 18:56:12 Your vows are on me , God . I will give thank offerings to you . 

$ 18:56:13 For you have delivered my soul from death , and prevented my feet from falling , that I may walk before God in the light of the living . 


$ 18:57:1 Be merciful to me , God , be merciful to me , for my soul takes refuge in you . Yes , in the shadow of your wings , I will take refuge , until disaster has passed . 

$ 18:57:2 I cry out to God Most High , to God who accomplishes my requests for me . 

$ 18:57:3 He will send from heaven , and save me , he rebukes the one who is pursuing me . Selah . God will send out his loving kindness and his truth . 

$ 18:57:4 My soul is among lions . I lie among those who are set on fire , even the sons of men , whose teeth are spears and arrows , and their tongue a sharp sword . 

$ 18:57:5 Be exalted , God , above the heavens ! Let your glory be above all the earth ! 

$ 18:57:6 They have prepared a net for my steps . My soul is bowed down . They dig a pit before me . They fall into the middle of it themselves . Selah . 

$ 18:57:7 My heart is steadfast , God , my heart is steadfast . I will sing , yes , I will sing praises . 

$ 18:57:8 Wake up , my glory ! Wake up , lute and harp ! I will wake up the dawn . 

$ 18:57:9 I will give thanks to you , Lord , among the peoples . I will sing praises to you among the nations . 

$ 18:57:10 For your great loving kindness reaches to the heavens , and your truth to the skies . 

$ 18:57:11 Be exalted , God , above the heavens . Let your glory be over all the earth . 


$ 18:58:1 Do you indeed speak righteousness , silent ones ? Do you judge blamelessly , you sons of men ? 

$ 18:58:2 No , in your heart you plot injustice . You measure out the violence of your hands in the earth . 

$ 18:58:3 The wicked go astray from the womb . They are wayward as soon as they are born , speaking lies . 

$ 18:58:4 Their poison is like the poison of a snake ; like a deaf cobra that stops its ear , 

$ 18:58:5 which doesn't listen to the voice of charmers , no matter how skillful the charmer may be . 

$ 18:58:6 Break their teeth , God , in their mouth . Break out the great teeth of the young lions , Yahweh . 

$ 18:58:7 Let them vanish like water that flows away . When they draw the bow , let their arrows be made blunt . 

$ 18:58:8 Let them be like a snail which melts and passes away , like the stillborn child , who has not seen the sun . 

$ 18:58:9 Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns , he will sweep away the green and the burning alike . 

$ 18:58:10 The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance . He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked ;

$ 18:59:2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity . Save me from the bloodthirsty men . 

$ 18:59:3 For , behold , they lie in wait for my soul . The mighty gather themselves together against me , not for my disobedience , nor for my sin , Yahweh . 

$ 18:59:4 I have done no wrong , yet they are ready to attack me . Rise up , behold , and help me ! 

$ 18:59:5 You , Yahweh God of Armies , the God of Israel , rouse yourself to punish the nations . Show no mercy to the wicked traitors . Selah . 

$ 18:59:6 They return at evening , howling like dogs , and prowl around the city . 

$ 18:59:7 Behold , they spew with their mouth . Swords are in their lips , <" For >" , they say , <" who hears us ? >" 

$ 18:59:8 But you , Yahweh , laugh at them . You scoff at all the nations . 

$ 18:59:9 Oh , my Strength , I watch for you , for God is my high tower . 

$ 18:59:10 My God will go before me with his loving kindness . God will let me look at my enemies in triumph . 

$ 18:59:11 Don't kill them , or my people may forget . Scatter them by your power , and bring them down , Lord our shield . 

$ 18:59:12 For the sin of their mouth , and the words of their lips , let them be caught in their pride , for the curses and lies which they utter . 

$ 18:59:13 Consume them in wrath . Consume them , and they will be no more . Let them know that God rules in Jacob , to the ends of the earth . Selah . 

$ 18:59:14 At evening let them return . Let them howl like a dog , and go around the city . 

$ 18:59:15 They shall wander up and down for food , and wait all night if they aren't satisfied . 

$ 18:59:16 But I will sing of your strength . Yes , I will sing aloud of your loving kindness in the morning . For you have been my high tower , a refuge in the day of my distress . 

$ 18:59:17 To you , my strength , I will sing praises . For God is my high tower , the God of my mercy . 
Naharaim and with Aram Zobah , and Joab returned , and killed twelve thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt . 

$ 18:60:1 God , you have rejected us . You have broken us down . You have been angry . Restore us , again . 

$ 18:60:2 You have made the land tremble . You have torn it . Mend its fractures , for it quakes . 

$ 18:60:3 You have shown your people hard things . You have made us drink the wine that makes us stagger . 

$ 18:60:4 You have given a banner to those who fear you , that it may be displayed because of the truth . Selah . 

$ 18:60:5 So that your beloved may be delivered , save with your right hand , and answer us . 

$ 18:60:6 God has spoken from his sanctuary : <" I will triumph . I will divide Shechem , and measure out the valley of Succoth . 

$ 18:60:7 Gilead is mine , and Manasseh is mine . Ephraim also is the defense of my head . Judah is my scepter . 

$ 18:60:8 Moab is my wash basin . I will throw my shoe on Edom . I shout in triumph over Philistia . >" 

$ 18:60:9 Who will bring me into the strong city ? Who has led me to Edom ? 

$ 18:60:10 Haven't you , God , rejected us ? You don't go out with our armies , God . 

$ 18:60:11 Give us help against the adversary , for the help of man is vain . 

$ 18:60:12 Through God we shall do valiantly , for it is he who will tread down our adversaries . 


$ 18:61:1 Hear my cry , God . Listen to my prayer . 

$ 18:61:2 From the end of the earth , I will call to you , when my heart is overwhelmed . Lead me to the rock that is higher than I . 

$ 18:61:3 For you have been a refuge for me , a strong tower from the enemy . 

$ 18:61:4 I will dwell in your tent forever . I will take refuge in the shelter of your wings . Selah . 

$ 18:61:5 For you , God , have heard my vows . You have given me the heritage of those who fear your name . 

$ 18:61:6 You will prolong the king's life ; his years shall be for generations . 

$ 18:61:7 He shall be enthroned in God's presence forever . Appoint your loving kindness and truth , that they may preserve him . 

$ 18:61:8 So I will sing praise to your name forever , that I may fulfill my vows daily . 


$ 18:62:1 My soul rests in God alone . My salvation is from him . 

$ 18:62:2 He alone is my rock and my salvation , my fortress - I will never be greatly shaken . 

$ 18:62:3 How long will you assault a man , would all of you throw him down , Like a leaning wall , like a tottering fence ? 

$ 18:62:4 They fully intend to throw him down from his lofty place . They delight in lies . They bless with their mouth , but they curse inwardly . Selah . 

$ 18:62:5 My soul , wait in silence for God alone , for my expectation is from him . 

$ 18:62:6 He alone is my rock and my salvation , my fortress . I will not be shaken . 

$ 18:62:7 With God is my salvation and my honor . The rock of my strength , and my refuge , is in God . 

$ 18:62:8 Trust in him at all times , you people . Pour out your heart before him . God is a refuge for us . Selah . 

$ 18:62:9 Surely men of low degree are just a breath , and men of high degree are a lie . In the balances they will go up . They are together lighter than a breath . 

$ 18:62:10 Don't trust in oppression . Don't become vain in robbery . If riches increase , don't set your heart on them . 

$ 18:62:11 God has spoken once ; twice I have heard this , that power belongs to God . 

$ 18:62:12 Also to you , Lord , belongs loving kindness , for you reward every man according to his work . 


$ 18:63:1 God , you are my God . I will earnestly seek you . My soul thirsts for you . My flesh longs for you , in a dry and weary land , where there is no water . 

$ 18:63:2 So I have seen you in the sanctuary , watching your power and your glory . 

$ 18:63:3 Because your loving kindness is better than life , my lips shall praise you . 

$ 18:63:4 So I will bless you while I live . I will lift up my hands in your name . 

$ 18:63:5 My soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food . My mouth shall praise you with joyful lips , 

$ 18:63:6 when I remember you on my bed , and think about you in the night watches . 

$ 18:63:7 For you have been my help . I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings . 

$ 18:63:8 My soul stays close to you . Your right hand holds me up . 

$ 18:63:9 But those who seek my soul , to destroy it , shall go into the lower parts of the earth . 

$ 18:63:10 They shall be given over to the power of the sword . They shall be jackal food . 

$ 18:63:11 But the king shall rejoice in God . Everyone who swears by him will praise him , for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be silenced . 


$ 18:64:1 Hear my voice , God , in my complaint . Preserve my life from fear of the enemy . 

$ 18:64:2 Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked , from the noisy crowd of the ones doing evil ; 

$ 18:64:3 who sharpen their tongue like a sword , and aim their arrows , deadly words , 

$ 18:64:4 to shoot innocent men from ambushes . They shoot at him suddenly and fearlessly . 

$ 18:64:5 They encourage themselves in evil plans . They talk about laying snares secretly . They say , <" Who will see them ? >" 

$ 18:64:6 They plot injustice , saying , <" We have made a perfect plan ! >" Surely man's mind and heart are cunning . 

$ 18:64:7 But God will shoot at them . They will be suddenly struck down with an arrow . 

$ 18:64:8 Their own tongues shall ruin them . All who see them will shake their heads . 

$ 18:64:9 All mankind shall be afraid . They shall declare the work of God , and shall wisely ponder what he has done . 

$ 18:64:10 The righteous shall be glad in Yahweh , and shall take refuge in him . All the upright in heart shall praise him ! 


$ 18:65:1 Praise waits for you , God , in Zion . To you shall vows be performed . 

$ 18:65:2 You who hear prayer , to you all men will come . 

$ 18:65:3 Sins overwhelmed me , but you atoned for our transgressions . 

$ 18:65:4 Blessed is the one whom you choose , and cause to come near , that he may live in your courts . We will be filled with the goodness of your house , your holy temple . 

$ 18:65:5 By awesome deeds of righteousness , you answer us , God of our salvation . You who are the hope of all the ends of the earth , of those who are far away on the sea ; 

$ 18:65:6 Who by his power forms the mountains , having armed yourself with strength ; 

$ 18:65:7 who stills the roaring of the seas , the roaring of their waves , and the turmoil of the nations . 

$ 18:65:8 They also who dwell in faraway places are afraid at your wonders . You call the morning's dawn and the evening with songs of joy . 

$ 18:65:9 You visit the earth , and water it . You greatly enrich it . The river of God is full of water . You provide them grain , for so you have ordained it . 

$ 18:65:10 You drench its furrows . You level its ridges . You soften it with showers . You bless it with a crop . 

$ 18:65:11 You crown the year with your bounty . Your carts overflow with abundance . 

$ 18:65:12 The wilderness grasslands overflow . The hills are clothed with gladness . 

$ 18:65:13 The pastures are covered with flocks . The valleys also are clothed with grain . They shout for joy ! They also sing . 


$ 18:66:1 Make a joyful shout to God , all the earth ! 

$ 18:66:2 Sing to the glory of his name ! Offer glory and praise ! 

$ 18:66:3 Tell God , <" How awesome are your deeds ! Through the greatness of your power , your enemies submit themselves to you . 

$ 18:66:4 All the earth will worship you , and will sing to you ; they will sing to your name . >" Selah . 

$ 18:66:5 Come , and see God's deeds - awesome work on behalf of the children of men . 

$ 18:66:6 He turned the sea into dry land . They went through the river on foot . There , we rejoiced in him . 

$ 18:66:7 He rules by his might forever . His eyes watch the nations . Don't let the rebellious rise up against him . Selah . 

$ 18:66:8 Praise our God , you peoples ! Make the sound of his praise heard , 

$ 18:66:9 who preserves our life among the living , and doesn't allow our feet to be moved . 

$ 18:66:10 For you , God , have tested us . You have refined us , as silver is refined . 

$ 18:66:11 You brought us into prison . You laid a burden on our backs . 

$ 18:66:12 You allowed men to ride over our heads . We went through fire and through water , but you brought us to the place of abundance . 

$ 18:66:13 I will come into your temple with burnt offerings . I will pay my vows to you , 

$ 18:66:14 which my lips promised , and my mouth spoke , when I was in distress . 

$ 18:66:15 I will offer to you burnt offerings of fat animals , with the offering of rams , I will offer bulls with goats . Selah . 

$ 18:66:16 Come , and hear , all you who fear God . I will declare what he has done for my soul . 

$ 18:66:17 I cried to him with my mouth . He was extolled with my tongue . 

$ 18:66:18 If I cherished sin in my heart , the Lord wouldn't have listened . 

$ 18:66:19 But most certainly , God has listened . He has heard the voice of my prayer . 

$ 18:66:20 Blessed be God , who has not turned away my prayer , nor his loving kindness from me . 


$ 18:67:1 May God be merciful to us , bless us , and cause his face to shine on us . Selah . 

$ 18:67:2 That your way may be known on earth , and your salvation among all nations , 

$ 18:67:3 let the peoples praise you , God . Let all the peoples praise you . 

$ 18:67:4 Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy , for you will judge the peoples with equity , and govern the nations on earth . Selah . 

$ 18:67:5 Let the peoples praise you , God . Let all the peoples praise you . 

$ 18:67:6 The earth has yielded its increase . God , even our own God , will bless us . 

$ 18:67:7 God will bless us . All the ends of the earth shall fear him . 


$ 18:68:1 Let God arise ! Let his enemies be scattered ! Let them who hate him also flee before him . 

$ 18:68:2 As smoke is driven away , so drive them away . As wax melts before the fire , so let the wicked perish at the presence of God . 

$ 18:68:3 But let the righteous be glad . Let them rejoice before God . Yes , let them rejoice with gladness . 

$ 18:68:4 Sing to God ! Sing praises to his name ! Extol him who rides on the clouds : to Yah , his name ! Rejoice before him ! 

$ 18:68:5 A father of the fatherless , and a defender of the widows , is God in his holy habitation . 

$ 18:68:6 God sets the lonely in families . He brings out the prisoners with singing , but the rebellious dwell in a sun - scorched land . 

$ 18:68:7 God , when you went out before your people , when you marched through the wilderness . . . Selah . 

$ 18:68:8 The earth trembled . The sky also poured down rain at the presence of the God of Sinai - at the presence of God , the God of Israel . 

$ 18:68:9 You , God , sent a plentiful rain . You confirmed your inheritance , when it was weary . 

$ 18:68:10 Your congregation lived therein . You , God , prepared your goodness for the poor . 

$ 18:68:11 The Lord announced the word . The ones who proclaim it are a great company . 

$ 18:68:12 <" Kings of armies flee ! They flee ! >" She who waits at home divides the plunder , 

$ 18:68:13 while you sleep among the camp fires , the wings of a dove sheathed with silver , her feathers with shining gold . 

$ 18:68:14 When the Almighty scattered kings in her , it snowed on Zalmon . 

$ 18:68:15 The mountains of Bashan are majestic mountains . The mountains of Bashan are rugged . 

$ 18:68:16 Why do you look in envy , you rugged mountains , at the mountain where God chooses to reign ? Yes , Yahweh will dwell there forever . 

$ 18:68:17 The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands . The Lord is among them , from Sinai , into the sanctuary . 

$ 18:68:18 You have ascended on high . You have led away captives . You have received gifts among people , yes , among the rebellious also , that Yah God might dwell there . 

$ 18:68:19 Blessed be the Lord , who daily bears our burdens , even the God who is our salvation . Selah . 

$ 18:68:20 God is to us a God of deliverance . To Yahweh , the Lord , belongs escape from death . 

$ 18:68:21 But God will strike through the head of his enemies , the hairy scalp of such a one as still continues in his guiltiness . 

$ 18:68:22 The Lord said , <" I will bring you again from Bashan , I will bring you again from the depths of the sea ; 

$ 18:68:23 That you may crush them , dipping your foot in blood , that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from your enemies . >" 

$ 18:68:24 They have seen your processions , God , even the processions of my God , my King , into the sanctuary . 

$ 18:68:25 The singers went before , the minstrels followed after , among the ladies playing with tambourines , 

$ 18:68:26 <" Bless God in the congregations , even the Lord in the assembly of Israel ! >" 

$ 18:68:27 There is little Benjamin , their ruler , the princes of Judah , their council , the princes of Zebulun , and the princes of Naphtali . 

$ 18:68:28 Your God has commanded your strength . Strengthen , God , that which you have done for us . 

$ 18:68:29 Because of your temple at Jerusalem , kings shall bring presents to you . 

$ 18:68:30 Rebuke the wild animal of the reeds , the multitude of the bulls , with the calves of the peoples . Being humbled , may it bring bars of silver . Scatter the nations that delight in war . 

$ 18:68:31 Princes shall come out of Egypt . Ethiopia shall hurry to stretch out her hands to God . 

$ 18:68:32 Sing to God , you kingdoms of the earth ! Sing praises to the Lord ! Selah . 

$ 18:68:33 To him who rides on the heaven of heavens , which are of old ; behold , he utters his voice , a mighty voice . 

$ 18:68:34 Ascribe strength to God ! His excellency is over Israel , his strength is in the skies . 

$ 18:68:35 You are awesome , God , in your sanctuaries . The God of Israel gives strength and power to his people . Praise be to God ! 


$ 18:69:1 Save me , God , for the waters have come up to my neck ! 

$ 18:69:2 I sink in deep mire , where there is no foothold . I have come into deep waters , where the floods overflow me . 

$ 18:69:3 I am weary with my crying . My throat is dry . My eyes fail , looking for my God . 

$ 18:69:4 Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head . Those who want to cut me off , being my enemies wrongfully , are mighty . I have to restore what I didn't take away . 

$ 18:69:5 God , you know my foolishness . My sins aren't hidden from you . 

$ 18:69:6 Don't let those who wait for you be shamed through me , Lord Yahweh of Armies . Don't let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me , God of Israel . 

$ 18:69:7 Because for your sake , I have borne reproach . Shame has covered my face . 

$ 18:69:8 I have become a stranger to my brothers , an alien to my mother's children . 

$ 18:69:9 For the zeal of your house consumes me . The reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me . 

$ 18:69:10 When I wept and I fasted , that was to my reproach . 

$ 18:69:11 When I made sackcloth my clothing , I became a byword to them . 

$ 18:69:12 Those who sit in the gate talk about me . I am the song of the drunkards . 

$ 18:69:13 But as for me , my prayer is to you , Yahweh , in an acceptable time . God , in the abundance of your loving kindness , answer me in the truth of your salvation . 

$ 18:69:14 Deliver me out of the mire , and don't let me sink . Let me be delivered from those who hate me , and out of the deep waters . 

$ 18:69:15 Don't let the flood waters overwhelm me , neither let the deep swallow me up . Don't let the pit shut its mouth on me . 

$ 18:69:16 Answer me , Yahweh , for your loving kindness is good . According to the multitude of your tender mercies , turn to me . 

$ 18:69:17 Don't hide your face from your servant , for I am in distress . Answer me speedily ! 

$ 18:69:18 Draw near to my soul , and redeem it . Ransom me because of my enemies . 

$ 18:69:19 You know my reproach , my shame , and my dishonor . My adversaries are all before you . 

$ 18:69:20 Reproach has broken my heart , and I am full of heaviness . I looked for some to take pity , but there was none ; for comforters , but I found none . 

$ 18:69:21 They also gave me gall for my food . In my thirst , they gave me vinegar to drink . 

$ 18:69:22 Let their table before them become a snare . May it become a retribution and a trap . 

$ 18:69:23 Let their eyes be darkened , so that they can't see . Let their backs be continually bent . 

$ 18:69:24 Pour out your indignation on them . Let the fierceness of your anger overtake them . 

$ 18:69:25 Let their habitation be desolate . Let no one dwell in their tents . 

$ 18:69:26 For they persecute him whom you have wounded . They tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt . 

$ 18:69:27 Charge them with crime upon crime . Don't let them come into your righteousness . 

$ 18:69:28 Let them be blotted out of the book of life , and not be written with the righteous . 

$ 18:69:29 But I am in pain and distress . Let your salvation , God , protect me . 

$ 18:69:30 I will praise the name of God with a song , and will magnify him with thanksgiving . 

$ 18:69:31 It will please Yahweh better than an ox , or a bull that has horns and hoofs . 

$ 18:69:32 The humble have seen it , and are glad . You who seek after God , let your heart live . 

$ 18:69:33 For Yahweh hears the needy , and doesn't despise his captive people . 

$ 18:69:34 Let heaven and earth praise him ; the seas , and everything that moves therein ! 

$ 18:69:35 For God will save Zion , and build the cities of Judah . They shall settle there , and own it . 

$ 18:69:36 The children also of his servants shall inherit it . Those who love his name shall dwell therein . 


$ 18:70:1 Hurry , God , to deliver me . Come quickly to help me , Yahweh . 

$ 18:70:2 Let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul . Let those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace . 

$ 18:70:3 Let them be turned because of their shame Who say , <" Aha ! Aha ! >" 

$ 18:70:4 Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you . Let those who love your salvation continually say , <" Let God be exalted ! >" 

$ 18:70:5 But I am poor and needy . Come to me quickly , God . You are my help and my deliverer . Yahweh , don't delay . 


$ 18:71:1 In you , Yahweh , I take refuge . Never let me be disappointed . 

$ 18:71:2 Deliver me in your righteousness , and rescue me . Turn your ear to me , and save me . 

$ 18:71:3 Be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go . Give the command to save me , for you are my rock and my fortress . 

$ 18:71:4 Rescue me , my God , from the hand of the wicked , from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man . 

$ 18:71:5 For you are my hope , Lord Yahweh ; my confidence from my youth . 

$ 18:71:6 I have relied on you from the womb . You are he who took me out of my mother's womb . I will always praise you . 

$ 18:71:7 I am a marvel to many , but you are my strong refuge . 

$ 18:71:8 My mouth shall be filled with your praise , with your honor all day long . 

$ 18:71:9 Don't reject me in my old age . Don't forsake me when my strength fails . 

$ 18:71:10 For my enemies talk about me . Those who watch for my soul conspire together , 

$ 18:71:11 saying , <" God has forsaken him . Pursue and take him , for no one will rescue him . >" 

$ 18:71:12 God , don't be far from me . My God , hurry to help me . 

$ 18:71:13 Let my accusers be disappointed and consumed . Let them be covered with disgrace and scorn who want to harm me . 

$ 18:71:14 But I will always hope , and will add to all of your praise . 

$ 18:71:15 My mouth will tell about your righteousness , and of your salvation all day , though I don't know its full measure . 

$ 18:71:16 I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Yahweh . I will make mention of your righteousness , even of yours alone . 

$ 18:71:17 God , you have taught me from my youth . Until now , I have declared your wondrous works . 

$ 18:71:18 Yes , even when I am old and gray - haired , God , don't forsake me , until I have declared your strength to the next generation , your might to everyone who is to come . 

$ 18:71:19 Your righteousness also , God , reaches to the heavens ; you have done great things . God , who is like you ? 

$ 18:71:20 You , who have shown us many and bitter troubles , you will let me live . You will bring us up again from the depths of the earth . 

$ 18:71:21 Increase my honor , and comfort me again . 

$ 18:71:22 I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness , my God . I sing praises to you with the lyre , Holy One of Israel . 

$ 18:71:23 My lips shall shout for joy ! My soul , which you have redeemed , sings praises to you ! 

$ 18:71:24 My tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long , for they are disappointed , and they are confounded , who want to harm me . 


$ 18:72:1 God , give the king your justice ; your righteousness to the royal son . 

$ 18:72:2 He will judge your people with righteousness , and your poor with justice . 

$ 18:72:3 The mountains shall bring prosperity to the people . The hills bring the fruit of righteousness . 

$ 18:72:4 He will judge the poor of the people . He will save the children of the needy , and will break the oppressor in pieces . 

$ 18:72:5 They shall fear you while the sun endures ; and as long as the moon , throughout all generations . 

$ 18:72:6 He will come down like rain on the mown grass , as showers that water the earth . 

$ 18:72:7 In his days , the righteous shall flourish , and abundance of peace , until the moon is no more . 

$ 18:72:8 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea , from the River to the ends of the earth . 

$ 18:72:9 Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him . His enemies shall lick the dust . 

$ 18:72:10 The kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring tribute . The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts . 

$ 18:72:11 Yes , all kings shall fall down before him . All nations shall serve him . 

$ 18:72:12 For he will deliver the needy when he cries ; the poor , who has no helper . 

$ 18:72:13 He will have pity on the poor and needy . He will save the souls of the needy . 

$ 18:72:14 He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence . Their blood will be precious in his sight . 

$ 18:72:15 They shall live , and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba . Men shall pray for him continually . They shall bless him all day long . 

$ 18:72:16 Abundance of grain shall be throughout the land . Its fruit sways like Lebanon . Let it flourish , thriving like the grass of the field . 

$ 18:72:17 His name endures forever . His name continues as long as the sun . Men shall be blessed by him . All nations will call him blessed . 

$ 18:72:18 Praise be to Yahweh God , the God of Israel , who alone does marvelous deeds . 

$ 18:72:19 Blessed be his glorious name forever ! Let the whole earth be filled with his glory ! Amen and amen . 

$ 18:72:20 This ends the prayers by David , the son of Jesse . 


$ 18:73:1 Surely God is good to Israel , to those who are pure in heart . 

$ 18:73:2 But as for me , my feet were almost gone . My steps had nearly slipped . 

$ 18:73:3 For I was envious of the arrogant , when I saw the prosperity of the wicked . 

$ 18:73:4 For there are no struggles in their death , but their strength is firm . 

$ 18:73:5 They are free from burdens of men , neither are they plagued like other men . 

$ 18:73:6 Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck . Violence covers them like a garment . 

$ 18:73:7 Their eyes bulge with fat . Their minds pass the limits of conceit . 

$ 18:73:8 They scoff and speak with malice . In arrogance , they threaten oppression . 

$ 18:73:9 They have set their mouth in the heavens . Their tongue walks through the earth . 

$ 18:73:10 Therefore their people return to them , and they drink up waters of abundance . 

$ 18:73:11 They say , <" How does God know ? Is there knowledge in the Most High ? >" 

$ 18:73:12 Behold , these are the wicked . Being always at ease , they increase in riches . 

$ 18:73:13 Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain , and washed my hands in innocence , 

$ 18:73:14 For all day long I have been plagued , and punished every morning . 

$ 18:73:15 If I had said , <" I will speak thus >" ; behold , I would have betrayed the generation of your children . 

$ 18:73:16 When I tried to understand this , it was too painful for me ; 

$ 18:73:17 Until I entered God's sanctuary , and considered their latter end . 

$ 18:73:18 Surely you set them in slippery places . You throw them down to destruction . 

$ 18:73:19 How they are suddenly destroyed ! They are completely swept away with terrors . 

$ 18:73:20 As a dream when one wakes up , so , Lord , when you awake , you will despise their fantasies . 

$ 18:73:21 For my soul was grieved . I was embittered in my heart . 

$ 18:73:22 I was so senseless and ignorant . I was a brute beast before you . 

$ 18:73:23 Nevertheless , I am continually with you . You have held my right hand . 

$ 18:73:24 You will guide me with your counsel , and afterward receive me to glory . 

$ 18:73:25 Whom do I have in heaven ? There is no one on earth whom I desire besides you . 

$ 18:73:26 My flesh and my heart fails , but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever . 

$ 18:73:27 For , behold , those who are far from you shall perish . You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you . 

$ 18:73:28 But it is good for me to come close to God . I have made the Lord Yahweh my refuge , that I may tell of all your works . 


$ 18:74:1 God , why have you rejected us forever ? Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture ? 

$ 18:74:2 Remember your congregation , which you purchased of old , which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance ; Mount Zion , in which you have lived . 

$ 18:74:3 Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins , all the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary . 

$ 18:74:4 Your adversaries have roared in the middle of your assembly . They have set up their standards as signs . 

$ 18:74:5 They behaved like men wielding axes , cutting through a thicket of trees . 

$ 18:74:6 Now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers . 

$ 18:74:7 They have burned your sanctuary to the ground . They have profaned the dwelling place of your Name . 

$ 18:74:8 They said in their heart , <" We will crush them completely . >" They have burned up all the places in the land where God was worshiped . 

$ 18:74:9 We see no miraculous signs . There is no longer any prophet , neither is there among us anyone who knows how long . 

$ 18:74:10 How long , God , shall the adversary reproach ? Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever ? 

$ 18:74:11 Why do you draw back your hand , even your right hand ? Take it from your chest and consume them ! 

$ 18:74:12 Yet God is my King of old , working salvation throughout the earth . 

$ 18:74:13 You divided the sea by your strength . You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters . 

$ 18:74:14 You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces . You gave him as food to people and desert creatures . 

$ 18:74:15 You opened up spring and stream . You dried up mighty rivers . 

$ 18:74:16 The day is yours , the night is also yours . You have prepared the light and the sun . 

$ 18:74:17 You have set all the boundaries of the earth . You have made summer and winter . 

$ 18:74:18 Remember this , that the enemy has mocked you , Yahweh . Foolish people have blasphemed your name . 

$ 18:74:19 Don't deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts . Don't forget the life of your poor forever . 

$ 18:74:20 Honor your covenant , for haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth . 

$ 18:74:21 Don't let the oppressed return ashamed . Let the poor and needy praise your name . 

$ 18:74:22 Arise , God ! Plead your own cause . Remember how the foolish man mocks you all day . 

$ 18:74:23 Don't forget the voice of your adversaries . The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually . 


$ 18:75:1 We give thanks to you , God . We give thanks , for your Name is near . Men tell about your wondrous works . 

$ 18:75:2 When I choose the appointed time , I will judge blamelessly . 

$ 18:75:3 The earth and all its inhabitants quake . I firmly hold its pillars . Selah . 

$ 18:75:4 I said to the arrogant , <" Don't boast ! >" I said to the wicked , <" Don't lift up the horn . 

$ 18:75:5 Don't lift up your horn on high . Don't speak with a stiff neck . >" 

$ 18:75:6 For neither from the east , nor from the west , nor yet from the south , comes exaltation . 

$ 18:75:7 But God is the judge . He puts down one , and lifts up another . 

$ 18:75:8 For in Yahweh's hand there is a cup , full of foaming wine mixed with spices . He pours it out . Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs . 

$ 18:75:9 But I will declare this forever : I will sing praises to the God of Jacob . 

$ 18:75:10 I will cut off all the horns of the wicked , but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up . 


$ 18:76:1 In Judah , God is known . His name is great in Israel . 

$ 18:76:2 His tabernacle is also in Salem ; His dwelling place in Zion . 

$ 18:76:3 There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow , the shield , and the sword , and the weapons of war . Selah . 

$ 18:76:4 Glorious are you , and excellent , more than mountains of game . 

$ 18:76:5 Valiant men lie plundered , they have slept their last sleep . None of the men of war can lift their hands . 

$ 18:76:6 At your rebuke , God of Jacob , both chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep . 

$ 18:76:7 You , even you , are to be feared . Who can stand in your sight when you are angry ? 

$ 18:76:8 You pronounced judgment from heaven . The earth feared , and was silent , 

$ 18:76:9 when God arose to judgment , to save all the afflicted ones of the earth . Selah . 

$ 18:76:10 Surely the wrath of man praises you . The survivors of your wrath are restrained . 

$ 18:76:11 Make vows to Yahweh your God , and fulfill them ! Let all of his neighbors bring presents to him who is to be feared . 

$ 18:76:12 He will cut off the spirit of princes . He is feared by the kings of the earth . 


$ 18:77:1 My cry goes to God ! Indeed , I cry to God for help , and for him to listen to me . 

$ 18:77:2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord . My hand was stretched out in the night , and didn't get tired . My soul refused to be comforted . 

$ 18:77:3 I remember God , and I groan . I complain , and my spirit is overwhelmed . Selah . 

$ 18:77:4 You hold my eyelids open . I am so troubled that I can't speak . 

$ 18:77:5 I have considered the days of old , the years of ancient times . 

$ 18:77:6 I remember my song in the night . I consider in my own heart ; my spirit diligently inquires : 

$ 18:77:7 <" Will the Lord reject us forever ? Will he be favorable no more ? 

$ 18:77:8 Has his loving kindness vanished forever ? Does his promise fail for generations ? 

$ 18:77:9 Has God forgotten to be gracious ? Has he , in anger , withheld his compassion ? >" Selah . 

$ 18:77:10 Then I thought , <" I will appeal to this : the years of the right hand of the Most High . >" 

$ 18:77:11 I will remember Yah's deeds ; for I will remember your wonders of old . 

$ 18:77:12 I will also meditate on all your work , and consider your doings . 

$ 18:77:13 Your way , God , is in the sanctuary . What god is great like God ? 

$ 18:77:14 You are the God who does wonders . You have made your strength known among the peoples . 

$ 18:77:15 You have redeemed your people with your arm , the sons of Jacob and Joseph . Selah . 

$ 18:77:16 The waters saw you , God . The waters saw you , and they writhed . The depths also convulsed . 

$ 18:77:17 The clouds poured out water . The skies resounded with thunder . Your arrows also flashed around . 

$ 18:77:18 The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind . The lightnings lit up the world . The earth trembled and shook . 

$ 18:77:19 Your way was through the sea ; your paths through the great waters . Your footsteps were not known . 

$ 18:77:20 You led your people like a flock , by the hand of Moses and Aaron . 


$ 18:78:1 Hear my teaching , my people . Turn your ears to the words of my mouth . 

$ 18:78:2 I will open my mouth in a parable . I will utter dark sayings of old , 

$ 18:78:3 Which we have heard and known , and our fathers have told us . 

$ 18:78:4 We will not hide them from their children , telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh , his strength , and his wondrous deeds that he has done . 

$ 18:78:5 For he established a covenant in Jacob , and appointed a teaching in Israel , which he commanded our fathers , that they should make them known to their children ; 

$ 18:78:6 that the generation to come might know , even the children who should be born ; who should arise and tell their children , 

$ 18:78:7 that they might set their hope in God , and not forget God's deeds , but keep his commandments , 

$ 18:78:8 and might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebellious generation , a generation that didn't make their hearts loyal , whose spirit was not steadfast with God . 

$ 18:78:9 The children of Ephraim , being armed and carrying bows , turned back in the day of battle . 

$ 18:78:10 They didn't keep God's covenant , and refused to walk in his law . 

$ 18:78:11 They forgot his doings , his wondrous deeds that he had shown them . 

$ 18:78:12 He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers , in the land of Egypt , in the field of Zoan . 

$ 18:78:13 He split the sea , and caused them to pass through . He made the waters stand as a heap . 

$ 18:78:14 In the daytime he also led them with a cloud , and all night with a light of fire . 

$ 18:78:15 He split rocks in the wilderness , and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths . 

$ 18:78:16 He brought streams also out of the rock , and caused waters to run down like rivers . 

$ 18:78:17 Yet they still went on to sin against him , to rebel against the Most High in the desert . 

$ 18:78:18 They tempted God in their heart by asking food according to their desire . 

$ 18:78:19 Yes , they spoke against God . They said , <" Can God prepare a table in the wilderness ? 

$ 18:78:20 Behold , he struck the rock , so that waters gushed out , and streams overflowed . Can he give bread also ? Will he provide meat for his people ? >" 

$ 18:78:21 Therefore Yahweh heard , and was angry . A fire was kindled against Jacob , anger also went up against Israel , 

$ 18:78:22 because they didn't believe in God , and didn't trust in his salvation . 

$ 18:78:23 Yet he commanded the skies above , and opened the doors of heaven . 

$ 18:78:24 He rained down manna on them to eat , and gave them food from the sky . 

$ 18:78:25 Man ate the bread of angels . He sent them food to the full . 

$ 18:78:26 He caused the east wind to blow in the sky . By his power he guided the south wind . 

$ 18:78:27 He rained also meat on them as the dust ; winged birds as the sand of the seas . 

$ 18:78:28 He let them fall in the middle of their camp , around their habitations . 

$ 18:78:29 So they ate , and were well filled . He gave them their own desire . 

$ 18:78:30 They didn't turn from their cravings . Their food was yet in their mouths , 

$ 18:78:31 when the anger of God went up against them , killed some of their fattest , and struck down the young men of Israel . 

$ 18:78:32 For all this they still sinned , and didn't believe in his wondrous works . 

$ 18:78:33 Therefore he consumed their days in vanity , and their years in terror . 

$ 18:78:34 When he killed them , then they inquired after him . They returned and sought God earnestly . 

$ 18:78:35 They remembered that God was their rock , the Most High God , their redeemer . 

$ 18:78:36 But they flattered him with their mouth , and lied to him with their tongue . 

$ 18:78:37 For their heart was not right with him , neither were they faithful in his covenant . 

$ 18:78:38 But he , being merciful , forgave iniquity , and didn't destroy them . Yes , many times he turned his anger away , and didn't stir up all his wrath . 

$ 18:78:39 He remembered that they were but flesh , a wind that passes away , and doesn't come again . 

$ 18:78:40 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness , and grieved him in the desert ! 

$ 18:78:41 They turned again and tempted God , and provoked the Holy One of Israel . 

$ 18:78:42 They didn't remember his hand , nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary ; 

$ 18:78:43 how he set his signs in Egypt , his wonders in the field of Zoan , 

$ 18:78:44 he turned their rivers into blood , and their streams , so that they could not drink . 

$ 18:78:45 He sent among them swarms of flies , which devoured them ; and frogs , which destroyed them . 

$ 18:78:46 He gave also their increase to the caterpillar , and their labor to the locust . 

$ 18:78:47 He destroyed their vines with hail , their sycamore fig trees with frost . 

$ 18:78:48 He gave over their livestock also to the hail , and their flocks to hot thunderbolts . 

$ 18:78:49 He threw on them the fierceness of his anger , wrath , indignation , and trouble , and a band of angels of evil . 

$ 18:78:50 He made a path for his anger . He didn't spare their soul from death , but gave their life over to the pestilence , 

$ 18:78:51 and struck all the firstborn in Egypt , the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham . 

$ 18:78:52 But he led out his own people like sheep , and guided them in the wilderness like a flock . 

$ 18:78:53 He led them safely , so that they weren't afraid , but the sea overwhelmed their enemies . 

$ 18:78:54 He brought them to the border of his sanctuary , to this mountain , which his right hand had taken . 

$ 18:78:55 He also drove out the nations before them , allotted them for an inheritance by line , and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents . 

$ 18:78:56 Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God , and didn't keep his testimonies ; 

$ 18:78:57 but turned back , and dealt treacherously like their fathers . They were twisted like a deceitful bow . 

$ 18:78:58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places , and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images . 

$ 18:78:59 When God heard this , he was angry , and greatly abhorred Israel ; 

$ 18:78:60 So that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh , the tent which he placed among men ; 

$ 18:78:61 and delivered his strength into captivity , his glory into the adversary's hand . 

$ 18:78:62 He also gave his people over to the sword , and was angry with his inheritance . 

$ 18:78:63 Fire devoured their young men . Their virgins had no wedding song . 

$ 18:78:64 Their priests fell by the sword , and their widows couldn't weep . 

$ 18:78:65 Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep , like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine . 

$ 18:78:66 He struck his adversaries backward . He put them to a perpetual reproach . 

$ 18:78:67 Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph , and didn't choose the tribe of Ephraim , 

$ 18:78:68 But chose the tribe of Judah , Mount Zion which he loved . 

$ 18:78:69 He built his sanctuary like the heights , like the earth which he has established forever . 

$ 18:78:70 He also chose David his servant , and took him from the sheepfolds ; 

$ 18:78:71 from following the ewes that have their young , he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob , his people , and Israel , his inheritance . 

$ 18:78:72 So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart , and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands . 


$ 18:79:1 God , the nations have come into your inheritance . They have defiled your holy temple . They have laid Jerusalem in heaps . 

$ 18:79:2 They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky , the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth . 

$ 18:79:3 Their blood they have shed like water around Jerusalem . There was no one to bury them . 

$ 18:79:4 We have become a reproach to our neighbors , a scoffing and derision to those who are around us . 

$ 18:79:5 How long , Yahweh ? Will you be angry forever ? Will your jealousy burn like fire ? 

$ 18:79:6 Pour out your wrath on the nations that don't know you ; on the kingdoms that don't call on your name ; 

$ 18:79:7 For they have devoured Jacob , and destroyed his homeland . 

$ 18:79:8 Don't hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us . Let your tender mercies speedily meet us , for we are in desperate need . 

$ 18:79:9 Help us , God of our salvation , for the glory of your name . Deliver us , and forgive our sins , for your name's sake . 

$ 18:79:10 Why should the nations say , <" Where is their God ? >" Let it be known among the nations , before our eyes , that vengeance for your servants' blood is being poured out . 

$ 18:79:11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you . According to the greatness of your power , preserve those who are sentenced to death . 

$ 18:79:12 Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom their reproach with which they have reproached you , Lord . 

$ 18:79:13 So we , your people and sheep of your pasture , will give you thanks forever . We will praise you forever , to all generations . 


$ 18:80:1 Hear us , Shepherd of Israel , you who lead Joseph like a flock , you who sit above the cherubim , shine out . 

$ 18:80:2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh , stir up your might ! Come to save us ! 

$ 18:80:3 Turn us again , God . Cause your face to shine , and we will be saved . 

$ 18:80:4 Yahweh God of Armies , How long will you be angry against the prayer of your people ? 

$ 18:80:5 You have fed them with the bread of tears , and given them tears to drink in large measure . 

$ 18:80:6 You make us a source of contention to our neighbors . Our enemies laugh among themselves . 

$ 18:80:7 Turn us again , God of Armies . Cause your face to shine , and we will be saved . 

$ 18:80:8 You brought a vine out of Egypt . You drove out the nations , and planted it . 

$ 18:80:9 You cleared the ground for it . It took deep root , and filled the land . 

$ 18:80:10 The mountains were covered with its shadow . Its boughs were like God's cedars . 

$ 18:80:11 It sent out its branches to the sea , Its shoots to the River . 

$ 18:80:12 Why have you broken down its walls , so that all those who pass by the way pluck it ? 

$ 18:80:13 The boar out of the wood ravages it . The wild animals of the field feed on it . 

$ 18:80:14 Turn again , we beg you , God of Armies . Look down from heaven , and see , and visit this vine , 

$ 18:80:15 the stock which your right hand planted , the branch that you made strong for yourself . 

$ 18:80:16 It's burned with fire . It's cut down . They perish at your rebuke . 

$ 18:80:17 Let your hand be on the man of your right hand , on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself . 

$ 18:80:18 So we will not turn away from you . Revive us , and we will call on your name . 

$ 18:80:19 Turn us again , Yahweh God of Armies . Cause your face to shine , and we will be saved . 


$ 18:81:1 Sing aloud to God , our strength ! Make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob ! 

$ 18:81:2 Raise a song , and bring here the tambourine , the pleasant lyre with the harp . 

$ 18:81:3 Blow the trumpet at the New Moon , at the full moon , on our feast day . 

$ 18:81:4 For it is a statute for Israel , an ordinance of the God of Jacob . 

$ 18:81:5 He appointed it in Joseph for a covenant , when he went out over the land of Egypt , I heard a language that I didn't know . 

$ 18:81:6 <" I removed his shoulder from the burden . His hands were freed from the basket . 

$ 18:81:7 You called in trouble , and I delivered you . I answered you in the secret place of thunder . I tested you at the waters of Meribah . >" Selah . 

$ 18:81:8 <" Hear , my people , and I will testify to you , Israel , if you would listen to me ! 

$ 18:81:9 There shall be no strange god in you , neither shall you worship any foreign god . 

$ 18:81:10 I am Yahweh , your God , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt . Open your mouth wide , and I will fill it . 

$ 18:81:11 But my people didn't listen to my voice . Israel desired none of me . 

$ 18:81:12 So I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts , that they might walk in their own counsels . 

$ 18:81:13 Oh that my people would listen to me , that Israel would walk in my ways ! 

$ 18:81:14 I would soon subdue their enemies , and turn my hand against their adversaries . 

$ 18:81:15 The haters of Yahweh would cringe before him , and their punishment would last forever . 

$ 18:81:16 But he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat . I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock . >" 


$ 18:82:1 God presides in the great assembly . He judges among the gods . 

$ 18:82:2 <" How long will you judge unjustly , and show partiality to the wicked ? >" Selah . 

$ 18:82:3 <" Defend the weak , the poor , and the fatherless . Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed . 

$ 18:82:4 Rescue the weak and needy . Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked . >" 

$ 18:82:5 They don't know , neither do they understand . They walk back and forth in darkness . All the foundations of the earth are shaken . 

$ 18:82:6 I said , <" You are gods , all of you are sons of the Most High . 

$ 18:82:7 Nevertheless you shall die like men , and fall like one of the rulers . >" 

$ 18:82:8 Arise , God , judge the earth , for you inherit all of the nations . 


$ 18:83:1 God , don't keep silent . Don't keep silent , and don't be still , God . 

$ 18:83:2 For , behold , your enemies are stirred up . Those who hate you have lifted up their heads . 

$ 18:83:3 They conspire with cunning against your people . They plot against your cherished ones . 

$ 18:83:4 <" Come , >" they say , <" let's destroy them as a nation , that the name of Israel may be remembered no more . >" 

$ 18:83:5 For they have conspired together with one mind . They form an alliance against you . 

$ 18:83:6 The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites ; Moab , and the Hagrites ; 

$ 18:83:7 Gebal , Ammon , and Amalek ; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre ; 

$ 18:83:8 Assyria also is joined with them . They have helped the children of Lot . Selah . 

$ 18:83:9 Do to them as you did to Midian , as to Sisera , as to Jabin , at the river Kishon ; 

$ 18:83:10 who perished at Endor , who became as dung for the earth . 

$ 18:83:11 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb ; yes , all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna ; 

$ 18:83:12 who said , <" Let's take possession of God's pasture lands . >" 

$ 18:83:13 My God , make them like tumbleweed ; like chaff before the wind . 

$ 18:83:14 As the fire that burns the forest , as the flame that sets the mountains on fire , 

$ 18:83:15 so pursue them with your tempest , and terrify them with your storm . 

$ 18:83:16 Fill their faces with confusion , that they may seek your name , Yahweh . 

$ 18:83:17 Let them be disappointed and dismayed forever . Yes , let them be confounded and perish ; 

$ 18:83:18 that they may know that you alone , whose name is Yahweh , are the Most High over all the earth . 


$ 18:84:1 How lovely are your dwellings , Yahweh of Armies ! 

$ 18:84:2 My soul longs , and even faints for the courts of Yahweh . My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God . 

$ 18:84:3 Yes , the sparrow has found a home , and the swallow a nest for herself , where she may have her young , near your altars , Yahweh of Armies , my King , and my God . 

$ 18:84:4 Blessed are those who dwell in your house . They are always praising you . Selah . 

$ 18:84:5 Blessed are those whose strength is in you ; who have set their hearts on a pilgrimage . 

$ 18:84:6 Passing through the valley of Weeping , they make it a place of springs . Yes , the autumn rain covers it with blessings . 

$ 18:84:7 They go from strength to strength . Everyone of them appears before God in Zion . 

$ 18:84:8 Yahweh , God of Armies , hear my prayer . Listen , God of Jacob . Selah . 

$ 18:84:9 Behold , God our shield , look at the face of your anointed . 

$ 18:84:10 For a day in your courts is better than a thousand . I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God , than to dwell in the tents of wickedness . 

$ 18:84:11 For Yahweh God is a sun and a shield . Yahweh will give grace and glory . He withholds no good thing from those who walk blamelessly . 

$ 18:84:12 Yahweh of Armies , blessed is the man who trusts in you . 


$ 18:85:1 Yahweh , you have been favorable to your land . You have restored the fortunes of Jacob . 

$ 18:85:2 You have forgiven the iniquity of your people . You have covered all their sin . Selah . 

$ 18:85:3 You have taken away all your wrath . You have turned from the fierceness of your anger . 

$ 18:85:4 Turn us , God of our salvation , and cause your indignation toward us to cease . 

$ 18:85:5 Will you be angry with us forever ? Will you draw out your anger to all generations ? 

$ 18:85:6 Won't you revive us again , that your people may rejoice in you ? 

$ 18:85:7 Show us your loving kindness , Yahweh . Grant us your salvation . 

$ 18:85:8 I will hear what God , Yahweh , will speak , for he will speak peace to his people , his saints ; but let them not turn again to folly . 

$ 18:85:9 Surely his salvation is near those who fear him , that glory may dwell in our land . 

$ 18:85:10 Mercy and truth meet together . Righteousness and peace have kissed each other . 

$ 18:85:11 Truth springs out of the earth . Righteousness has looked down from heaven . 

$ 18:85:12 Yes , Yahweh will give that which is good . Our land will yield its increase . 

$ 18:85:13 Righteousness goes before him , And prepares the way for his steps . 


$ 18:86:1 Hear , Yahweh , and answer me , for I am poor and needy . 

$ 18:86:2 Preserve my soul , for I am godly . You , my God , save your servant who trusts in you . 

$ 18:86:3 Be merciful to me , Lord , for I call to you all day long . 

$ 18:86:4 Bring joy to the soul of your servant , for to you , Lord , do I lift up my soul . 

$ 18:86:5 For you , Lord , are good , and ready to forgive ; abundant in loving kindness to all those who call on you . 

$ 18:86:6 Hear , Yahweh , my prayer . Listen to the voice of my petitions . 

$ 18:86:7 In the day of my trouble I will call on you , for you will answer me . 

$ 18:86:8 There is no one like you among the gods , Lord , nor any deeds like your deeds . 

$ 18:86:9 All nations you have made will come and worship before you , Lord . They shall glorify your name . 

$ 18:86:10 For you are great , and do wondrous things . You are God alone . 

$ 18:86:11 Teach me your way , Yahweh . I will walk in your truth . Make my heart undivided to fear your name . 

$ 18:86:12 I will praise you , Lord my God , with my whole heart . I will glorify your name forever more . 

$ 18:86:13 For your loving kindness is great toward me . You have delivered my soul from the lowest Sheol . 

$ 18:86:14 God , the proud have risen up against me . A company of violent men have sought after my soul , and they don't hold regard for you before them . 

$ 18:86:15 But you , Lord , are a merciful and gracious God , slow to anger , and abundant in loving kindness and truth . 

$ 18:86:16 Turn to me , and have mercy on me ! Give your strength to your servant . Save the son of your servant . 

$ 18:86:17 Show me a sign of your goodness , that those who hate me may see it , and be shamed , because you , Yahweh , have helped me , and comforted me . 


$ 18:87:1 His foundation is in the holy mountains . 

$ 18:87:2 Yahweh loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob . 

$ 18:87:3 Glorious things are spoken about you , city of God . Selah . 

$ 18:87:4 I will record Rahab and Babylon among those who acknowledge me . Behold , Philistia , Tyre , and also Ethiopia : <" This one was born there . >" 

$ 18:87:5 Yes , of Zion it will be said , <" This one and that one was born in her ; >" the Most High himself will establish her . 

$ 18:87:6 Yahweh will count , when he writes up the peoples , <" This one was born there . >" Selah . 

$ 18:87:7 Those who sing as well as those who dance say , <" All my springs are in you . >" 
by Heman , the Ezrahite . 

$ 18:88:1 Yahweh , the God of my salvation , I have cried day and night before you . 

$ 18:88:2 Let my prayer enter into your presence . Turn your ear to my cry . 

$ 18:88:3 For my soul is full of troubles . My life draws near to Sheol . 

$ 18:88:4 I am counted among those who go down into the pit . I am like a man who has no help , 

$ 18:88:5 set apart among the dead , like the slain who lie in the grave , whom you remember no more . They are cut off from your hand . 

$ 18:88:6 You have laid me in the lowest pit , in the darkest depths . 

$ 18:88:7 Your wrath lies heavily on me . You have afflicted me with all your waves . Selah . 

$ 18:88:8 You have taken my friends from me . You have made me an abomination to them . I am confined , and I can't escape . 

$ 18:88:9 My eyes are dim from grief . I have called on you daily , Yahweh . I have spread out my hands to you . 

$ 18:88:10 Do you show wonders to the dead ? Do the departed spirits rise up and praise you ? Selah . 

$ 18:88:11 Is your loving kindness declared in the grave ? Or your faithfulness in Destruction ? 

$ 18:88:12 Are your wonders made known in the dark ? Or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness ? 

$ 18:88:13 But to you , Yahweh , I have cried . In the morning , my prayer comes before you . 

$ 18:88:14 Yahweh , why do you reject my soul ? Why do you hide your face from me ? 

$ 18:88:15 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up . While I suffer your terrors , I am distracted . 

$ 18:88:16 Your fierce wrath has gone over me . Your terrors have cut me off . 

$ 18:88:17 They came around me like water all day long . They completely engulfed me . 

$ 18:88:18 You have put lover and friend far from me , and my friends into darkness . 


$ 18:89:1 I will sing of the loving kindness of Yahweh forever . With my mouth , I will make known your faithfulness to all generations . 

$ 18:89:2 I indeed declare , <" Love stands firm forever . You established the heavens . Your faithfulness is in them . >" 

$ 18:89:3 <" I have made a covenant with my chosen one , I have sworn to David , my servant , 

$ 18:89:4 <' I will establish your offspring forever , and build up your throne to all generations . >' >" Selah . 

$ 18:89:5 The heavens will praise your wonders , Yahweh ; your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones . 

$ 18:89:6 For who in the skies can be compared to Yahweh ? Who among the sons of the heavenly beings is like Yahweh , 

$ 18:89:7 a very awesome God in the council of the holy ones , to be feared above all those who are around him ? 

$ 18:89:8 Yahweh , God of Armies , who is a mighty one , like you ? Yah , your faithfulness is around you . 

$ 18:89:9 You rule the pride of the sea . When its waves rise up , you calm them . 

$ 18:89:10 You have broken Rahab in pieces , like one of the slain . You have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm . 

$ 18:89:11 The heavens are yours . The earth also is yours ; the world and its fullness . You have founded them . 

$ 18:89:12 The north and the south , you have created them . Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name . 

$ 18:89:13 You have a mighty arm . Your hand is strong , and your right hand is exalted . 

$ 18:89:14 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne . Loving kindness and truth go before your face . 

$ 18:89:15 Blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you . They walk in the light of your presence , Yahweh . 

$ 18:89:16 In your name they rejoice all day . In your righteousness , they are exalted . 

$ 18:89:17 For you are the glory of their strength . In your favor , our horn will be exalted . 

$ 18:89:18 For our shield belongs to Yahweh ; our king to the Holy One of Israel . 

$ 18:89:19 Then you spoke in vision to your saints , and said , <" I have given strength to the warrior . I have exalted a young man from the people . 

$ 18:89:20 I have found David , my servant . I have anointed him with my holy oil , 

$ 18:89:21 with whom my hand shall be established . My arm will also strengthen him . 

$ 18:89:22 No enemy will tax him . No wicked man will oppress him . 

$ 18:89:23 I will beat down his adversaries before him , and strike those who hate him . 

$ 18:89:24 But my faithfulness and my loving kindness will be with him . In my name , his horn will be exalted . 

$ 18:89:25 I will set his hand also on the sea , and his right hand on the rivers . 

$ 18:89:26 He will call to me , <' You are my Father , my God , and the rock of my salvation ! >' 

$ 18:89:27 I will also appoint him my firstborn , the highest of the kings of the earth . 

$ 18:89:28 I will keep my loving kindness for him forever more . My covenant will stand firm with him . 

$ 18:89:29 I will also make his offspring endure forever , and his throne as the days of heaven . 

$ 18:89:30 If his children forsake my law , and don't walk in my ordinances ; 

$ 18:89:31 if they break my statutes , and don't keep my commandments ; 

$ 18:89:32 then I will punish their sin with the rod , and their iniquity with stripes . 

$ 18:89:33 But I will not completely take my loving kindness from him , nor allow my faithfulness to fail . 

$ 18:89:34 I will not break my covenant , nor alter what my lips have uttered . 

$ 18:89:35 Once I have sworn by my holiness , I will not lie to David . 

$ 18:89:36 His offspring will endure forever , his throne like the sun before me . 

$ 18:89:37 It will be established forever like the moon , the faithful witness in the sky . >" Selah . 

$ 18:89:38 But you have rejected and spurned . You have been angry with your anointed . 

$ 18:89:39 You have renounced the covenant of your servant . You have defiled his crown in the dust . 

$ 18:89:40 You have broken down all his hedges . You have brought his strongholds to ruin . 

$ 18:89:41 All who pass by the way rob him . He has become a reproach to his neighbors . 

$ 18:89:42 You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries . You have made all of his enemies rejoice . 

$ 18:89:43 Yes , you turn back the edge of his sword , and haven't supported him in battle . 

$ 18:89:44 You have ended his splendor , and thrown his throne down to the ground . 

$ 18:89:45 You have shortened the days of his youth . You have covered him with shame . Selah . 

$ 18:89:46 How long , Yahweh ? Will you hide yourself forever ? Will your wrath burn like fire ? 

$ 18:89:47 Remember how short my time is ! For what vanity have you created all the children of men ! 

$ 18:89:48 What man is he who shall live and not see death , who shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol ? Selah . 

$ 18:89:49 Lord , where are your former loving kindnesses , which you swore to David in your faithfulness ? 

$ 18:89:50 Remember , Lord , the reproach of your servants , how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the mighty peoples , 

$ 18:89:51 With which your enemies have mocked , Yahweh , with which they have mocked the footsteps of your anointed one . 

$ 18:89:52 Blessed be Yahweh forever more . Amen , and Amen . 
( Elohim ) . you have been our dwelling place for all generations . 

$ 18:90:1 Before the mountains were born , before you had formed the earth and the world , even from everlasting to everlasting , you are God . 

$ 18:90:2 You turn man to destruction , saying , <" Return , you children of men . >" 

$ 18:90:3 For a thousand years in your sight are just like yesterday when it is past , like a watch in the night . 

$ 18:90:4 You sweep them away as they sleep . In the morning they sprout like new grass . 

$ 18:90:5 In the morning it sprouts and springs up . By evening , it is withered and dry . 

$ 18:90:6 For we are consumed in your anger . We are troubled in your wrath . 

$ 18:90:7 You have set our iniquities before you , our secret sins in the light of your presence . 

$ 18:90:8 For all our days have passed away in your wrath . We bring our years to an end as a sigh . 

$ 18:90:9 The days of our years are seventy , or even by reason of strength eighty years ; yet their pride is but labor and sorrow , for it passes quickly , and we fly away . 

$ 18:90:10 Who knows the power of your anger , your wrath according to the fear that is due to you ? 

$ 18:90:11 So teach us to count our days , that we may gain a heart of wisdom . 

$ 18:90:12 Relent , Yahweh ! How long ? Have compassion on your servants ! 

$ 18:90:13 Satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness , that we may rejoice and be glad all our days . 

$ 18:90:14 Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us , for as many years as we have seen evil . 

$ 18:90:15 Let your work appear to your servants ; your glory to their children . 

$ 18:90:16 Let the favor of the Lord our God be on us ; establish the work of our hands for us ; yes , establish the work of our hands . 


$ 18:91:1 He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty . 

$ 18:91:2 I will say of Yahweh , <" He is my refuge and my fortress ; my God , in whom I trust . >" 

$ 18:91:3 For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler , and from the deadly pestilence . 

$ 18:91:4 He will cover you with his feathers . Under his wings you will take refuge . His faithfulness is your shield and rampart . 

$ 18:91:5 You shall not be afraid of the terror by night , nor of the arrow that flies by day ; 

$ 18:91:6 nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness , nor of the destruction that wastes at noonday . 

$ 18:91:7 A thousand may fall at your side , and ten thousand at your right hand ; but it will not come near you . 

$ 18:91:8 You will only look with your eyes , and see the recompense of the wicked . 

$ 18:91:9 Because you have made Yahweh your refuge , and the Most High your dwelling place , 

$ 18:91:10 no evil shall happen to you , neither shall any plague come near your dwelling . 

$ 18:91:11 For he will put his angels in charge of you , to guard you in all your ways . 

$ 18:91:12 They will bear you up in their hands , so that you won't dash your foot against a stone . 

$ 18:91:13 You will tread on the lion and cobra . You will trample the young lion and the serpent underfoot . 

$ 18:91:14 <" Because he has set his love on me , therefore I will deliver him . I will set him on high , because he has known my name . 

$ 18:91:15 He will call on me , and I will answer him . I will be with him in trouble . I will deliver him , and honor him . 

$ 18:91:16 I will satisfy him with long life , and show him my salvation . >" 


$ 18:92:1 It is a good thing to give thanks to Yahweh , to sing praises to your name , Most High ; 

$ 18:92:2 to proclaim your loving kindness in the morning , and your faithfulness every night , 

$ 18:92:3 with the ten - stringed lute , with the harp , and with the melody of the lyre . 

$ 18:92:4 For you , Yahweh , have made me glad through your work . I will triumph in the works of your hands . 

$ 18:92:5 How great are your works , Yahweh ! Your thoughts are very deep . 

$ 18:92:6 A senseless man doesn't know , neither does a fool understand this : 

$ 18:92:7 though the wicked spring up as the grass , and all the evildoers flourish , they will be destroyed forever . 

$ 18:92:8 But you , Yahweh , are on high forever more . 

$ 18:92:9 For , behold , your enemies , Yahweh , for , behold , your enemies shall perish . All the evildoers will be scattered . 

$ 18:92:10 But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox . I am anointed with fresh oil . 

$ 18:92:11 My eye has also seen my enemies . My ears have heard of the wicked enemies who rise up against me . 

$ 18:92:12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree . He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon . 

$ 18:92:13 They are planted in Yahweh's house . They will flourish in our God's courts . 

$ 18:92:14 They will still produce fruit in old age . They will be full of sap and green , 

$ 18:92:15 to show that Yahweh is upright . He is my rock , and there is no unrighteousness in him . 


$ 18:93:1 Yahweh reigns ! He is clothed with majesty ! Yahweh is armed with strength . The world also is established . It can't be moved . 

$ 18:93:2 Your throne is established from long ago . You are from everlasting . 

$ 18:93:3 The floods have lifted up , Yahweh , the floods have lifted up their voice . The floods lift up their waves . 

$ 18:93:4 Above the voices of many waters , the mighty breakers of the sea , Yahweh on high is mighty . 

$ 18:93:5 Your statutes stand firm . Holiness adorns your house , Yahweh , forever more . 


$ 18:94:1 Yahweh , you God to whom vengeance belongs , you God to whom vengeance belongs , shine out . 

$ 18:94:2 Rise up , you judge of the earth . Pay back the proud what they deserve . 

$ 18:94:3 Yahweh , how long will the wicked , how long will the wicked triumph ? 

$ 18:94:4 They pour out arrogant words . All the evildoers boast . 

$ 18:94:5 They break your people in pieces , Yahweh , and afflict your heritage . 

$ 18:94:6 They kill the widow and the alien , and murder the fatherless . 

$ 18:94:7 They say , <" Yah will not see , neither will Jacob's God consider . >" 

$ 18:94:8 Consider , you senseless among the people ; you fools , when will you be wise ? 

$ 18:94:9 He who implanted the ear , won't he hear ? He who formed the eye , won't he see ? 

$ 18:94:10 He who disciplines the nations , won't he punish ? He who teaches man knows . 

$ 18:94:11 Yahweh knows the thoughts of man , that they are futile . 

$ 18:94:12 Blessed is the man whom you discipline , Yah , and teach out of your law ; 

$ 18:94:13 that you may give him rest from the days of adversity , until the pit is dug for the wicked . 

$ 18:94:14 For Yahweh won't reject his people , neither will he forsake his inheritance . 

$ 18:94:15 For judgment will return to righteousness . All the upright in heart shall follow it . 

$ 18:94:16 Who will rise up for me against the wicked ? Who will stand up for me against the evildoers ? 

$ 18:94:17 Unless Yahweh had been my help , my soul would have soon lived in silence . 

$ 18:94:18 When I said , <" My foot is slipping ! >" Your loving kindness , Yahweh , held me up . 

$ 18:94:19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me , your comforts delight my soul . 

$ 18:94:20 Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you , which brings about mischief by statute ? 

$ 18:94:21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous , and condemn the innocent blood . 

$ 18:94:22 But Yahweh has been my high tower , my God , the rock of my refuge . 

$ 18:94:23 He has brought on them their own iniquity , and will cut them off in their own wickedness . Yahweh , our God , will cut them off . 


$ 18:95:1 Oh come , let's sing to Yahweh . Let's shout aloud to the rock of our salvation ! 

$ 18:95:2 Let's come before his presence with thanksgiving . Let's extol him with songs ! 

$ 18:95:3 For Yahweh is a great God , a great King above all gods . 

$ 18:95:4 In his hand are the deep places of the earth . The heights of the mountains are also his . 

$ 18:95:5 The sea is his , and he made it . His hands formed the dry land . 

$ 18:95:6 Oh come , let's worship and bow down . Let's kneel before Yahweh , our Maker , 

$ 18:95:7 for he is our God . We are the people of his pasture , and the sheep in his care . Today , oh that you would hear his voice ! 

$ 18:95:8 Don't harden your heart , as at Meribah , as in the day of Massah in the wilderness , 

$ 18:95:9 when your fathers tempted me , tested me , and saw my work . 

$ 18:95:10 Forty long years I was grieved with that generation , and said , <" It is a people that errs in their heart . They have not known my ways . >" 

$ 18:95:11 Therefore I swore in my wrath , <" They won't enter into my rest . >" 


$ 18:96:1 Sing to Yahweh a new song ! Sing to Yahweh , all the earth . 

$ 18:96:2 Sing to Yahweh ! Bless his name ! Proclaim his salvation from day to day ! 

$ 18:96:3 Declare his glory among the nations , his marvelous works among all the peoples . 

$ 18:96:4 For great is Yahweh , and greatly to be praised ! He is to be feared above all gods . 

$ 18:96:5 For all the gods of the peoples are idols , but Yahweh made the heavens . 

$ 18:96:6 Honor and majesty are before him . Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary . 

$ 18:96:7 Ascribe to Yahweh , you families of nations , ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength . 

$ 18:96:8 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name . Bring an offering , and come into his courts . 

$ 18:96:9 Worship Yahweh in holy array . Tremble before him , all the earth . 

$ 18:96:10 Say among the nations , <" Yahweh reigns . >" The world is also established . It can't be moved . He will judge the peoples with equity . 

$ 18:96:11 Let the heavens be glad , and let the earth rejoice . Let the sea roar , and its fullness ! 

$ 18:96:12 Let the field and all that is in it exult ! Then all the trees of the woods shall sing for joy 

$ 18:96:13 before Yahweh ; for he comes , for he comes to judge the earth . He will judge the world with righteousness , the peoples with his truth . 


$ 18:97:1 Yahweh reigns ! Let the earth rejoice ! Let the multitude of islands be glad ! 

$ 18:97:2 Clouds and darkness are around him . Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne . 

$ 18:97:3 A fire goes before him , and burns up his adversaries on every side . 

$ 18:97:4 His lightning lights up the world . The earth sees , and trembles . 

$ 18:97:5 The mountains melt like wax at the presence of Yahweh , at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth . 

$ 18:97:6 The heavens declare his righteousness . All the peoples have seen his glory . 

$ 18:97:7 Let all them be shamed who serve engraved images , who boast in their idols . Worship him , all you gods ! 

$ 18:97:8 Zion heard and was glad . The daughters of Judah rejoiced , because of your judgments , Yahweh . 

$ 18:97:9 For you , Yahweh , are most high above all the earth . You are exalted far above all gods . 

$ 18:97:10 You who love Yahweh , hate evil . He preserves the souls of his saints . He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked . 

$ 18:97:11 Light is sown for the righteous , and gladness for the upright in heart . 

$ 18:97:12 Be glad in Yahweh , you righteous people ! Give thanks to his holy Name . 


$ 18:98:1 Sing to Yahweh a new song , for he has done marvelous things ! His right hand , and his holy arm , have worked salvation for him . 

$ 18:98:2 Yahweh has made known his salvation . He has openly shown his righteousness in the sight of the nations . 

$ 18:98:3 He has remembered his loving kindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel . All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God . 

$ 18:98:4 Make a joyful noise to Yahweh , all the earth ! Burst out and sing for joy , yes , sing praises ! 

$ 18:98:5 Sing praises to Yahweh with the harp , with the harp and the voice of melody . 

$ 18:98:6 With trumpets and sound of the ram's horn , make a joyful noise before the King , Yahweh . 

$ 18:98:7 Let the sea roar with its fullness ; the world , and those who dwell therein . 

$ 18:98:8 Let the rivers clap their hands . Let the mountains sing for joy together . 

$ 18:98:9 Let them sing before Yahweh , for he comes to judge the earth . He will judge the world with righteousness , and the peoples with equity . 


$ 18:99:1 Yahweh reigns ! Let the peoples tremble . He sits enthroned among the cherubim . Let the earth be moved . 

$ 18:99:2 Yahweh is great in Zion . He is high above all the peoples . 

$ 18:99:3 Let them praise your great and awesome name . He is Holy ! 

$ 18:99:4 The King's strength also loves justice . You do establish equity . You execute justice and righteousness in Jacob . 

$ 18:99:5 Exalt Yahweh our God . Worship at his footstool . He is Holy ! 

$ 18:99:6 Moses and Aaron were among his priests , Samuel among those who call on his name ; they called on Yahweh , and he answered them . 

$ 18:99:7 He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud . They kept his testimonies , the statute that he gave them . 

$ 18:99:8 You answered them , Yahweh our God . You are a God who forgave them , although you took vengeance for their doings . 

$ 18:99:9 Exalt Yahweh , our God . Worship at his holy hill , for Yahweh , our God , is holy ! 


$ 18:100:1 Shout for joy to Yahweh , all you lands ! 

$ 18:100:2 Serve Yahweh with gladness . Come before his presence with singing . 

$ 18:100:3 Know that Yahweh , he is God . It is he who has made us , and we are his . We are his people , and the sheep of his pasture . 

$ 18:100:4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving , into his courts with praise . Give thanks to him , and bless his name . 

$ 18:100:5 For Yahweh is good . His loving kindness endures forever , his faithfulness to all generations . 


$ 18:101:1 I will sing of loving kindness and justice . To you , Yahweh , I will sing praises . 

$ 18:101:2 I will be careful to live a blameless life . When will you come to me ? I will walk within my house with a blameless heart . 

$ 18:101:3 I will set no vile thing before my eyes . I hate the deeds of faithless men . They will not cling to me . 

$ 18:101:4 A perverse heart will be far from me . I will have nothing to do with evil . 

$ 18:101:5 I will silence whoever secretly slanders his neighbor . I won't tolerate one who is arrogant and conceited . 

$ 18:101:6 My eyes will be on the faithful of the land , that they may dwell with me . He who walks in a perfect way , he will serve me . 

$ 18:101:7 He who practices deceit won't dwell within my house . He who speaks falsehood won't be established before my eyes . 

$ 18:101:8 Morning by morning , I will destroy all the wicked of the land ; to cut off all the workers of iniquity from Yahweh's city . 


$ 18:102:1 Hear my prayer , Yahweh ! Let my cry come to you . 

$ 18:102:2 Don't hide your face from me in the day of my distress . Turn your ear to me . Answer me quickly in the day when I call . 

$ 18:102:3 For my days consume away like smoke . My bones are burned as a torch . 

$ 18:102:4 My heart is blighted like grass , and withered , for I forget to eat my bread . 

$ 18:102:5 By reason of the voice of my groaning , my bones stick to my skin . 

$ 18:102:6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness . I have become as an owl of the waste places . 

$ 18:102:7 I watch , and have become like a sparrow that is alone on the housetop . 

$ 18:102:8 My enemies reproach me all day . Those who are mad at me use my name as a curse . 

$ 18:102:9 For I have eaten ashes like bread , and mixed my drink with tears , 

$ 18:102:10 Because of your indignation and your wrath , for you have taken me up , and thrown me away . 

$ 18:102:11 My days are like a long shadow . I have withered like grass . 

$ 18:102:12 But you , Yahweh , will remain forever ; your renown endures to all generations . 

$ 18:102:13 You will arise and have mercy on Zion ; for it is time to have pity on her . Yes , the set time has come . 

$ 18:102:14 For your servants take pleasure in her stones , and have pity on her dust . 

$ 18:102:15 So the nations will fear Yahweh's name ; all the kings of the earth your glory . 

$ 18:102:16 For Yahweh has built up Zion . He has appeared in his glory . 

$ 18:102:17 He has responded to the prayer of the destitute , and has not despised their prayer . 

$ 18:102:18 This will be written for the generation to come . A people which will be created will praise Yah . 

$ 18:102:19 For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary . From heaven , Yahweh saw the earth ; 

$ 18:102:20 to hear the groans of the prisoner ; to free those who are condemned to death ; 

$ 18:102:21 that men may declare Yahweh's name in Zion , and his praise in Jerusalem ; 

$ 18:102:22 when the peoples are gathered together , the kingdoms , to serve Yahweh . 

$ 18:102:23 He weakened my strength along the course . He shortened my days . 

$ 18:102:24 I said , <" My God , don't take me away in the middle of my days . Your years are throughout all generations . 

$ 18:102:25 Of old , you laid the foundation of the earth . The heavens are the work of your hands . 

$ 18:102:26 They will perish , but you will endure . Yes , all of them will wear out like a garment . You will change them like a cloak , and they will be changed . 

$ 18:102:27 But you are the same . Your years will have no end . 

$ 18:102:28 The children of your servants will continue . Their offspring will be established before you . >" 


$ 18:103:1 Praise Yahweh , my soul ! All that is within me , praise his holy name ! 

$ 18:103:2 Praise Yahweh , my soul , and don't forget all his benefits ; 

$ 18:103:3 who forgives all your sins ; who heals all your diseases ; 

$ 18:103:4 who redeems your life from destruction ; who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies ; 

$ 18:103:5 who satisfies your desire with good things , so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's . 

$ 18:103:6 Yahweh executes righteous acts , and justice for all who are oppressed . 

$ 18:103:7 He made known his ways to Moses , his deeds to the children of Israel . 

$ 18:103:8 Yahweh is merciful and gracious , slow to anger , and abundant in loving kindness . 

$ 18:103:9 He will not always accuse ; neither will he stay angry forever . 

$ 18:103:10 He has not dealt with us according to our sins , nor repaid us for our iniquities . 

$ 18:103:11 For as the heavens are high above the earth , so great is his loving kindness toward those who fear him . 

$ 18:103:12 As far as the east is from the west , so far has he removed our transgressions from us . 

$ 18:103:13 Like a father has compassion on his children , so Yahweh has compassion on those who fear him . 

$ 18:103:14 For he knows how we are made . He remembers that we are dust . 

$ 18:103:15 As for man , his days are like grass . As a flower of the field , so he flourishes . 

$ 18:103:16 For the wind passes over it , and it is gone . Its place remembers it no more . 

$ 18:103:17 But Yahweh's loving kindness is from everlasting to everlasting with those who fear him , his righteousness to children's children ; 

$ 18:103:18 to those who keep his covenant , to those who remember to obey his precepts . 

$ 18:103:19 Yahweh has established his throne in the heavens . His kingdom rules over all . 

$ 18:103:20 Praise Yahweh , you angels of his , who are mighty in strength , who fulfill his word , obeying the voice of his word . 

$ 18:103:21 Praise Yahweh , all you armies of his , you servants of his , who do his pleasure . 

$ 18:103:22 Praise Yahweh , all you works of his , in all places of his dominion . Praise Yahweh , my soul ! 


$ 18:104:1 Bless Yahweh , my soul . Yahweh , my God , you are very great . You are clothed with honor and majesty . 

$ 18:104:2 He covers himself with light as with a garment . He stretches out the heavens like a curtain . 

$ 18:104:3 He lays the beams of his rooms in the waters . He makes the clouds his chariot . He walks on the wings of the wind . 

$ 18:104:4 He makes his messengers winds ; his servants flames of fire . 

$ 18:104:5 He laid the foundations of the earth , that it should not be moved forever . 

$ 18:104:6 You covered it with the deep as with a cloak . The waters stood above the mountains . 

$ 18:104:7 At your rebuke they fled . At the voice of your thunder they hurried away . 

$ 18:104:8 The mountains rose , the valleys sank down , to the place which you had assigned to them . 

$ 18:104:9 You have set a boundary that they may not pass over ; that they don't turn again to cover the earth . 

$ 18:104:10 He sends springs into the valleys . They run among the mountains . 

$ 18:104:11 They give drink to every animal of the field . The wild donkeys quench their thirst . 

$ 18:104:12 The birds of the sky nest by them . They sing among the branches . 

$ 18:104:13 He waters the mountains from his rooms . The earth is filled with the fruit of your works . 

$ 18:104:14 He causes the grass to grow for the livestock , and plants for man to cultivate , that he may produce food out of the earth : 

$ 18:104:15 wine that makes glad the heart of man , oil to make his face to shine , and bread that strengthens man's heart . 

$ 18:104:16 Yahweh's trees are well watered , the cedars of Lebanon , which he has planted ; 

$ 18:104:17 where the birds make their nests . The stork makes its home in the cypress trees . 

$ 18:104:18 The high mountains are for the wild goats . The rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers . 

$ 18:104:19 He appointed the moon for seasons . The sun knows when to set . 

$ 18:104:20 You make darkness , and it is night , in which all the animals of the forest prowl . 

$ 18:104:21 The young lions roar after their prey , and seek their food from God . 

$ 18:104:22 The sun rises , and they steal away , and lay down in their dens . 

$ 18:104:23 Man goes out to his work , to his labor until the evening . 

$ 18:104:24 Yahweh , how many are your works ! In wisdom have you made them all . The earth is full of your riches . 

$ 18:104:25 There is the sea , great and wide , in which are innumerable living things , both small and large animals . 

$ 18:104:26 There the ships go , and leviathan , whom you formed to play there . 

$ 18:104:27 These all wait for you , that you may give them their food in due season . 

$ 18:104:28 You give to them ; they gather . You open your hand ; they are satisfied with good . 

$ 18:104:29 You hide your face : they are troubled ; you take away their breath : they die , and return to the dust . 

$ 18:104:30 You send out your Spirit and they are created . You renew the face of the ground . 

$ 18:104:31 Let Yahweh's glory endure forever . Let Yahweh rejoice in his works . 

$ 18:104:32 He looks at the earth , and it trembles . He touches the mountains , and they smoke . 

$ 18:104:33 I will sing to Yahweh as long as I live . I will sing praise to my God while I have any being . 

$ 18:104:34 Let my meditation be sweet to him . I will rejoice in Yahweh . 

$ 18:104:35 Let sinners be consumed out of the earth . Let the wicked be no more . Bless Yahweh , my soul . Praise Yah ! 


$ 18:105:1 Give thanks to Yahweh ! Call on his name ! Make his doings known among the peoples . 

$ 18:105:2 Sing to him , sing praises to him ! Tell of all his marvelous works . 

$ 18:105:3 Glory in his holy name . Let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice . 

$ 18:105:4 Seek Yahweh and his strength . Seek his face forever more . 

$ 18:105:5 Remember his marvelous works that he has done ; his wonders , and the judgments of his mouth , 

$ 18:105:6 you offspring of Abraham , his servant , you children of Jacob , his chosen ones . 

$ 18:105:7 He is Yahweh , our God . His judgments are in all the earth . 

$ 18:105:8 He has remembered his covenant forever , the word which he commanded to a thousand generations , 

$ 18:105:9 the covenant which he made with Abraham , his oath to Isaac , 

$ 18:105:10 and confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute ; to Israel for an everlasting covenant , 

$ 18:105:11 saying , <" To you I will give the land of Canaan , the lot of your inheritance ; >" 

$ 18:105:12 when they were but a few men in number , yes , very few , and foreigners in it . 

$ 18:105:13 They went about from nation to nation , from one kingdom to another people . 

$ 18:105:14 He allowed no one to do them wrong . Yes , he reproved kings for their sakes , 

$ 18:105:15 <" Don't touch my anointed ones ! Do my prophets no harm ! >" 

$ 18:105:16 He called for a famine on the land . He destroyed the food supplies . 

$ 18:105:17 He sent a man before them . Joseph was sold for a slave . 

$ 18:105:18 They bruised his feet with shackles . His neck was locked in irons , 

$ 18:105:19 until the time that his word happened , and Yahweh's word proved him true . 

$ 18:105:20 The king sent and freed him ; even the ruler of peoples , and let him go free . 

$ 18:105:21 He made him lord of his house , and ruler of all of his possessions ; 

$ 18:105:22 to discipline his princes at his pleasure , and to teach his elders wisdom . 

$ 18:105:23 Israel also came into Egypt . Jacob lived in the land of Ham . 

$ 18:105:24 He increased his people greatly , and made them stronger than their adversaries . 

$ 18:105:25 He turned their heart to hate his people , to conspire against his servants . 

$ 18:105:26 He sent Moses , his servant , and Aaron , whom he had chosen . 

$ 18:105:27 They performed miracles among them , and wonders in the land of Ham . 

$ 18:105:28 He sent darkness , and made it dark . They didn't rebel against his words . 

$ 18:105:29 He turned their waters into blood , and killed their fish . 

$ 18:105:30 Their land swarmed with frogs , even in the rooms of their kings . 

$ 18:105:31 He spoke , and swarms of flies came , and lice in all their borders . 

$ 18:105:32 He gave them hail for rain , with lightning in their land . 

$ 18:105:33 He struck their vines and also their fig trees , and shattered the trees of their country . 

$ 18:105:34 He spoke , and the locusts came , and the grasshoppers , without number , 

$ 18:105:35 ate up every plant in their land ; and ate up the fruit of their ground . 

$ 18:105:36 He struck also all the firstborn in their land , the first fruits of all their manhood . 

$ 18:105:37 He brought them out with silver and gold . There was not one feeble person among his tribes . 

$ 18:105:38 Egypt was glad when they departed , for the fear of them had fallen on them . 

$ 18:105:39 He spread a cloud for a covering , fire to give light in the night . 

$ 18:105:40 They asked , and he brought quails , and satisfied them with the bread of the sky . 

$ 18:105:41 He opened the rock , and waters gushed out . They ran as a river in the dry places . 

$ 18:105:42 For he remembered his holy word , and Abraham , his servant . 

$ 18:105:43 He brought his people out with joy , his chosen with singing . 

$ 18:105:44 He gave them the lands of the nations . They took the labor of the peoples in possession , 

$ 18:105:45 that they might keep his statutes , and observe his laws . Praise Yah ! 


$ 18:106:1 Praise Yahweh ! Give thanks to Yahweh , for he is good , for his loving kindness endures forever . 

$ 18:106:2 Who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh , or fully declare all his praise ? 

$ 18:106:3 Blessed are those who keep justice . Blessed is one who does what is right at all times . 

$ 18:106:4 Remember me , Yahweh , with the favor that you show to your people . Visit me with your salvation , 

$ 18:106:5 that I may see the prosperity of your chosen , that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation , that I may glory with your inheritance . 

$ 18:106:6 We have sinned with our fathers . We have committed iniquity . We have done wickedly . 

$ 18:106:7 Our fathers didn't understand your wonders in Egypt . They didn't remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses , but were rebellious at the sea , even at the Red Sea . 

$ 18:106:8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake , that he might make his mighty power known . 

$ 18:106:9 He rebuked the Red Sea also , and it was dried up ; so he led them through the depths , as through a desert . 

$ 18:106:10 He saved them from the hand of him who hated them , and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy . 

$ 18:106:11 The waters covered their adversaries . There was not one of them left . 

$ 18:106:12 Then they believed his words . They sang his praise . 

$ 18:106:13 They soon forgot his works . They didn't wait for his counsel , 

$ 18:106:14 but gave in to craving in the desert , and tested God in the wasteland . 

$ 18:106:15 He gave them their request , but sent leanness into their soul . 

$ 18:106:16 They envied Moses also in the camp , and Aaron , Yahweh's saint . 

$ 18:106:17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan , and covered the company of Abiram . 

$ 18:106:18 A fire was kindled in their company . The flame burned up the wicked . 

$ 18:106:19 They made a calf in Horeb , and worshiped a molten image . 

$ 18:106:20 Thus they exchanged their glory for an image of a bull that eats grass . 

$ 18:106:21 They forgot God , their Savior , who had done great things in Egypt , 

$ 18:106:22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham , and awesome things by the Red Sea . 

$ 18:106:23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them , had Moses , his chosen , not stood before him in the breach , to turn away his wrath , so that he wouldn't destroy them . 

$ 18:106:24 Yes , they despised the pleasant land . They didn't believe his word , 

$ 18:106:25 but murmured in their tents , and didn't listen to Yahweh's voice . 

$ 18:106:26 Therefore he swore to them that he would overthrow them in the wilderness , 

$ 18:106:27 that he would overthrow their offspring among the nations , and scatter them in the lands . 

$ 18:106:28 They joined themselves also to Baal Peor , and ate the sacrifices of the dead . 

$ 18:106:29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds . The plague broke in on them . 

$ 18:106:30 Then Phinehas stood up , and executed judgment , so the plague was stopped . 

$ 18:106:31 That was credited to him for righteousness , for all generations to come . 

$ 18:106:32 They angered him also at the waters of Meribah , so that Moses was troubled for their sakes ; 

$ 18:106:33 because they were rebellious against his spirit , he spoke rashly with his lips . 

$ 18:106:34 They didn't destroy the peoples , as Yahweh commanded them , 

$ 18:106:35 but mixed themselves with the nations , and learned their works . 

$ 18:106:36 They served their idols , which became a snare to them . 

$ 18:106:37 Yes , they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons . 

$ 18:106:38 They shed innocent blood , even the blood of their sons and of their daughters , whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan . The land was polluted with blood . 

$ 18:106:39 Thus were they defiled with their works , and prostituted themselves in their deeds . 

$ 18:106:40 Therefore Yahweh burned with anger against his people . He abhorred his inheritance . 

$ 18:106:41 He gave them into the hand of the nations . Those who hated them ruled over them . 

$ 18:106:42 Their enemies also oppressed them . They were brought into subjection under their hand . 

$ 18:106:43 He rescued them many times , but they were rebellious in their counsel , and were brought low in their iniquity . 

$ 18:106:44 Nevertheless he regarded their distress , when he heard their cry . 

$ 18:106:45 He remembered for them his covenant , and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses . 

$ 18:106:46 He made them also to be pitied by all those who carried them captive . 

$ 18:106:47 Save us , Yahweh , our God , gather us from among the nations , to give thanks to your holy name , to triumph in your praise ! 

$ 18:106:48 Blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , from everlasting even to everlasting ! Let all the people say , <" Amen . >" Praise Yah ! 


$ 18:107:1 Give thanks to Yahweh , for he is good , for his loving kindness endures forever . 

$ 18:107:2 Let the redeemed by Yahweh say so , whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary , 

$ 18:107:3 And gathered out of the lands , from the east and from the west , from the north and from the south . 

$ 18:107:4 They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way . They found no city to live in . 

$ 18:107:5 Hungry and thirsty , their soul fainted in them . 

$ 18:107:6 Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble , and he delivered them out of their distresses , 

$ 18:107:7 he led them also by a straight way , that they might go to a city to live in . 

$ 18:107:8 Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness , for his wonderful deeds to the children of men ! 

$ 18:107:9 For he satisfies the longing soul . He fills the hungry soul with good . 

$ 18:107:10 Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death , being bound in affliction and iron , 

$ 18:107:11 because they rebelled against the words of God , and condemned the counsel of the Most High . 

$ 18:107:12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labor . They fell down , and there was no one to help . 

$ 18:107:13 Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble , and he saved them out of their distresses . 

$ 18:107:14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death , and broke away their chains . 

$ 18:107:15 Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness , for his wonderful deeds to the children of men ! 

$ 18:107:16 For he has broken the gates of bronze , and cut through bars of iron . 

$ 18:107:17 Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience , and because of their iniquities . 

$ 18:107:18 Their soul abhors all kinds of food . They draw near to the gates of death . 

$ 18:107:19 Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble , he saves them out of their distresses . 

$ 18:107:20 He sends his word , and heals them , and delivers them from their graves . 

$ 18:107:21 Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness , for his wonderful deeds to the children of men ! 

$ 18:107:22 Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving , and declare his deeds with singing . 

$ 18:107:23 Those who go down to the sea in ships , who do business in great waters ; 

$ 18:107:24 These see Yahweh's deeds , and his wonders in the deep . 

$ 18:107:25 For he commands , and raises the stormy wind , which lifts up its waves . 

$ 18:107:26 They mount up to the sky ; they go down again to the depths . Their soul melts away because of trouble . 

$ 18:107:27 They reel back and forth , and stagger like a drunken man , and are at their wits' end . 

$ 18:107:28 Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble , and he brings them out of their distress . 

$ 18:107:29 He makes the storm a calm , so that its waves are still . 

$ 18:107:30 Then they are glad because it is calm , so he brings them to their desired haven . 

$ 18:107:31 Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness , for his wonderful deeds for the children of men ! 

$ 18:107:32 Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people , and praise him in the seat of the elders . 

$ 18:107:33 He turns rivers into a desert , water springs into a thirsty ground , 

$ 18:107:34 and a fruitful land into a salt waste , for the wickedness of those who dwell in it . 

$ 18:107:35 He turns a desert into a pool of water , and a dry land into water springs . 

$ 18:107:36 There he makes the hungry live , that they may prepare a city to live in , 

$ 18:107:37 sow fields , plant vineyards , and reap the fruits of increase . 

$ 18:107:38 He blesses them also , so that they are multiplied greatly . He doesn't allow their livestock to decrease . 

$ 18:107:39 Again , they are diminished and bowed down through oppression , trouble , and sorrow . 

$ 18:107:40 He pours contempt on princes , and causes them to wander in a trackless waste . 

$ 18:107:41 Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction , and increases their families like a flock . 

$ 18:107:42 The upright will see it , and be glad . All the wicked will shut their mouths . 

$ 18:107:43 Whoever is wise will pay attention to these things . They will consider the loving kindnesses of Yahweh . 


$ 18:108:1 My heart is steadfast , God . I will sing and I will make music with my soul . 

$ 18:108:2 Wake up , harp and lyre ! I will wake up the dawn . 

$ 18:108:3 I will give thanks to you , Yahweh , among the nations . I will sing praises to you among the peoples . 

$ 18:108:4 For your loving kindness is great above the heavens . Your faithfulness reaches to the skies . 

$ 18:108:5 Be exalted , God , above the heavens ! Let your glory be over all the earth . 

$ 18:108:6 That your beloved may be delivered , save with your right hand , and answer us . 

$ 18:108:7 God has spoken from his sanctuary : <" In triumph , I will divide Shechem , and measure out the valley of Succoth . 

$ 18:108:8 Gilead is mine . Manasseh is mine . Ephraim also is my helmet . Judah is my scepter . 

$ 18:108:9 Moab is my wash pot . I will toss my sandal on Edom . I will shout over Philistia . >" 

$ 18:108:10 Who will bring me into the fortified city ? Who has led me to Edom ? 

$ 18:108:11 Haven't you rejected us , God ? You don't go out , God , with our armies . 

$ 18:108:12 Give us help against the enemy , for the help of man is vain . 

$ 18:108:13 Through God , we will do valiantly . For it is he who will tread down our enemies . 


$ 18:109:1 God of my praise , don't remain silent , 

$ 18:109:2 for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit against me . They have spoken to me with a lying tongue . 

$ 18:109:3 They have also surrounded me with words of hatred , and fought against me without a cause . 

$ 18:109:4 In return for my love , they are my adversaries ; but I am in prayer . 

$ 18:109:5 They have rewarded me evil for good , and hatred for my love . 

$ 18:109:6 Set a wicked man over him . Let an adversary stand at his right hand . 

$ 18:109:7 When he is judged , let him come out guilty . Let his prayer be turned into sin . 

$ 18:109:8 Let his days be few . Let another take his office . 

$ 18:109:9 Let his children be fatherless , and his wife a widow . 

$ 18:109:10 Let his children be wandering beggars . Let them be sought from their ruins . 

$ 18:109:11 Let the creditor seize all that he has . Let strangers plunder the fruit of his labor . 

$ 18:109:12 Let there be no one to extend kindness to him , neither let there be anyone to have pity on his fatherless children . 

$ 18:109:13 Let his posterity be cut off . In the generation following let their name be blotted out . 

$ 18:109:14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by Yahweh . Don't let the sin of his mother be blotted out . 

$ 18:109:15 Let them be before Yahweh continually , that he may cut off their memory from the earth ; 

$ 18:109:16 because he didn't remember to show kindness , but persecuted the poor and needy man , the broken in heart , to kill them . 

$ 18:109:17 Yes , he loved cursing , and it came to him . He didn't delight in blessing , and it was far from him . 

$ 18:109:18 He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment . It came into his inward parts like water , like oil into his bones . 

$ 18:109:19 Let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers himself , for the belt that is always around him . 

$ 18:109:20 This is the reward of my adversaries from Yahweh , of those who speak evil against my soul . 

$ 18:109:21 But deal with me , Yahweh the Lord , for your name's sake , because your loving kindness is good , deliver me ; 

$ 18:109:22 for I am poor and needy . My heart is wounded within me . 

$ 18:109:23 I fade away like an evening shadow . I am shaken off like a locust . 

$ 18:109:24 My knees are weak through fasting . My body is thin and lacks fat . 

$ 18:109:25 I have also become a reproach to them . When they see me , they shake their head . 

$ 18:109:26 Help me , Yahweh , my God . Save me according to your loving kindness ; 

$ 18:109:27 that they may know that this is your hand ; that you , Yahweh , have done it . 

$ 18:109:28 They may curse , but you bless . When they arise , they will be shamed , but your servant shall rejoice . 

$ 18:109:29 Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor . Let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe . 

$ 18:109:30 I will give great thanks to Yahweh with my mouth . Yes , I will praise him among the multitude . 

$ 18:109:31 For he will stand at the right hand of the needy , to save him from those who judge his soul . 


$ 18:110:1 Yahweh says to my Lord , <" Sit at my right hand , until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet . >" 

$ 18:110:2 Yahweh will send out the rod of your strength out of Zion . Rule among your enemies . 

$ 18:110:3 Your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power , in holy array . Out of the womb of the morning , you have the dew of your youth . 

$ 18:110:4 Yahweh has sworn , and will not change his mind : <" You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek . >" 

$ 18:110:5 The Lord is at your right hand . He will crush kings in the day of his wrath . 

$ 18:110:6 He will judge among the nations . He will heap up dead bodies . He will crush the ruler of the whole earth . 

$ 18:110:7 He will drink of the brook on the way ; therefore he will lift up his head . 


$ 18:111:1 Praise Yah ! I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart , in the council of the upright , and in the congregation . 

$ 18:111:2 Yahweh's works are great , pondered by all those who delight in them . 

$ 18:111:3 His work is honor and majesty . His righteousness endures forever . 

$ 18:111:4 He has caused his wonderful works to be remembered . Yahweh is gracious and merciful . 

$ 18:111:5 He has given food to those who fear him . He always remembers his covenant . 

$ 18:111:6 He has shown his people the power of his works , in giving them the heritage of the nations . 

$ 18:111:7 The works of his hands are truth and justice . All his precepts are sure . 

$ 18:111:8 They are established forever and ever . They are done in truth and uprightness . 

$ 18:111:9 He has sent redemption to his people . He has ordained his covenant forever . His name is holy and awesome ! 

$ 18:111:10 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom . All those who do his work have a good understanding . His praise endures forever ! 


$ 18:112:1 Praise Yah ! Blessed is the man who fears Yahweh , who delights greatly in his commandments . 

$ 18:112:2 His offspring will be mighty in the land . The generation of the upright will be blessed . 

$ 18:112:3 Wealth and riches are in his house . His righteousness endures forever . 

$ 18:112:4 Light dawns in the darkness for the upright , gracious , merciful , and righteous . 

$ 18:112:5 It is well with the man who deals graciously and lends . He will maintain his cause in judgment . 

$ 18:112:6 For he will never be shaken . The righteous will be remembered forever . 

$ 18:112:7 He will not be afraid of evil news . His heart is steadfast , trusting in Yahweh . 

$ 18:112:8 His heart is established . He will not be afraid in the end when he sees his adversaries . 

$ 18:112:9 He has dispersed , he has given to the poor . His righteousness endures forever . His horn will be exalted with honor . 

$ 18:112:10 The wicked will see it , and be grieved . He shall gnash with his teeth , and melt away . The desire of the wicked will perish . 


$ 18:113:1 Praise Yah ! Praise , you servants of Yahweh , praise Yahweh's name . 

$ 18:113:2 Blessed be Yahweh's name , from this time forward and forever more . 

$ 18:113:3 From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same , Yahweh's name is to be praised . 

$ 18:113:4 Yahweh is high above all nations , his glory above the heavens . 

$ 18:113:5 Who is like Yahweh , our God , who has his seat on high , 

$ 18:113:6 Who stoops down to see in heaven and in the earth ? 

$ 18:113:7 He raises up the poor out of the dust . Lifts up the needy from the ash heap ; 

$ 18:113:8 that he may set him with princes , even with the princes of his people . 

$ 18:113:9 He settles the barren woman in her home , as a joyful mother of children . Praise Yah ! 


$ 18:114:1 When Israel went out of Egypt , the house of Jacob from a people of foreign language ; 

$ 18:114:2 Judah became his sanctuary , Israel his dominion . 

$ 18:114:3 The sea saw it , and fled . The Jordan was driven back . 

$ 18:114:4 The mountains skipped like rams , the little hills like lambs . 

$ 18:114:5 What was it , you sea , that you fled ? You Jordan , that you turned back ? 

$ 18:114:6 You mountains , that you skipped like rams ; you little hills , like lambs ? 

$ 18:114:7 Tremble , you earth , at the presence of the Lord , at the presence of the God of Jacob , 

$ 18:114:8 who turned the rock into a pool of water , the flint into a spring of waters . 


$ 18:115:1 Not to us , Yahweh , not to us , but to your name give glory , for your loving kindness , and for your truth's sake . 

$ 18:115:2 Why should the nations say , <" Where is their God , now ? >" 

$ 18:115:3 But our God is in the heavens . He does whatever he pleases . 

$ 18:115:4 Their idols are silver and gold , the work of men's hands . 

$ 18:115:5 They have mouths , but they don't speak . They have eyes , but they don't see . 

$ 18:115:6 They have ears , but they don't hear . They have noses , but they don't smell . 

$ 18:115:7 They have hands , but they don't feel . They have feet , but they don't walk , neither do they speak through their throat . 

$ 18:115:8 Those who make them will be like them ; yes , everyone who trusts in them . 

$ 18:115:9 Israel , trust in Yahweh ! He is their help and their shield . 

$ 18:115:10 House of Aaron , trust in Yahweh ! He is their help and their shield . 

$ 18:115:11 You who fear Yahweh , trust in Yahweh ! He is their help and their shield . 

$ 18:115:12 Yahweh remembers us . He will bless us . He will bless the house of Israel . He will bless the house of Aaron . 

$ 18:115:13 He will bless those who fear Yahweh , both small and great . 

$ 18:115:14 May Yahweh increase you more and more , you and your children . 

$ 18:115:15 Blessed are you by Yahweh , who made heaven and earth . 

$ 18:115:16 The heavens are the heavens of Yahweh ; but the earth has he given to the children of men . 

$ 18:115:17 The dead don't praise Yah , neither any who go down into silence ; 

$ 18:115:18 But we will bless Yah , from this time forward and forever more . Praise Yah ! 


$ 18:116:1 I love Yahweh , because he listens to my voice , and my cries for mercy . 

$ 18:116:2 Because he has turned his ear to me , therefore I will call on him as long as I live . 

$ 18:116:3 The cords of death surrounded me , the pains of Sheol got a hold of me . I found trouble and sorrow . 

$ 18:116:4 Then I called on Yahweh's name : <" Yahweh , I beg you , deliver my soul . >" 

$ 18:116:5 Yahweh is Gracious and righteous . Yes , our God is merciful . 

$ 18:116:6 Yahweh preserves the simple . I was brought low , and he saved me . 

$ 18:116:7 Return to your rest , my soul , for Yahweh has dealt bountifully with you . 

$ 18:116:8 For you have delivered my soul from death , my eyes from tears , and my feet from falling . 

$ 18:116:9 I will walk before Yahweh in the land of the living . 

$ 18:116:10 I believed , therefore I said , <" I was greatly afflicted . >" 

$ 18:116:11 I said in my haste , <" All people are liars . >" 

$ 18:116:12 What will I give to Yahweh for all his benefits toward me ? 

$ 18:116:13 I will take the cup of salvation , and call on Yahweh's name . 

$ 18:116:14 I will pay my vows to Yahweh , yes , in the presence of all his people . 

$ 18:116:15 Precious in Yahweh's sight is the death of his saints . 

$ 18:116:16 Yahweh , truly I am your servant . I am your servant , the son of your servant . You have freed me from my chains . 

$ 18:116:17 I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving , and will call on Yahweh's name . 

$ 18:116:18 I will pay my vows to Yahweh , yes , in the presence of all his people , 

$ 18:116:19 in the courts of Yahweh's house , in the middle of you , Jerusalem . Praise Yah ! 


$ 18:117:1 Praise Yahweh , all you nations ! Extol him , all you peoples ! 

$ 18:117:2 For his loving kindness is great toward us . Yahweh's faithfulness endures forever . Praise Yah ! 


$ 18:118:1 Give thanks to Yahweh , for he is good , for his loving kindness endures forever . 

$ 18:118:2 Let Israel now say that his loving kindness endures forever . 

$ 18:118:3 Let the house of Aaron now say that his loving kindness endures forever . 

$ 18:118:4 Now let those who fear Yahweh say that his loving kindness endures forever . 

$ 18:118:5 Out of my distress , I called on Yah . Yah answered me with freedom . 

$ 18:118:6 Yahweh is on my side . I will not be afraid . What can man do to me ? 

$ 18:118:7 Yahweh is on my side among those who help me . Therefore I will look in triumph at those who hate me . 

$ 18:118:8 It is better to take refuge in Yahweh , than to put confidence in man . 

$ 18:118:9 It is better to take refuge in Yahweh , than to put confidence in princes . 

$ 18:118:10 All the nations surrounded me , but in Yahweh's name , I cut them off . 

$ 18:118:11 They surrounded me , yes , they surrounded me . In Yahweh's name I indeed cut them off . 

$ 18:118:12 They surrounded me like bees . They are quenched like the burning thorns . In Yahweh's name I cut them off . 

$ 18:118:13 You pushed me back hard , to make me fall , but Yahweh helped me . 

$ 18:118:14 Yah is my strength and song . He has become my salvation . 

$ 18:118:15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous . <" The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly . 

$ 18:118:16 The right hand of Yahweh is exalted ! The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly ! >" 

$ 18:118:17 I will not die , but live , and declare Yah's works . 

$ 18:118:18 Yah has punished me severely , but he has not given me over to death . 

$ 18:118:19 Open to me the gates of righteousness . I will enter into them . I will give thanks to Yah . 

$ 18:118:20 This is the gate of Yahweh ; the righteous will enter into it . 

$ 18:118:21 I will give thanks to you , for you have answered me , and have become my salvation . 

$ 18:118:22 The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone . 

$ 18:118:23 This is Yahweh's doing . It is marvelous in our eyes . 

$ 18:118:24 This is the day that Yahweh has made . We will rejoice and be glad in it ! 

$ 18:118:25 Save us now , we beg you , Yahweh ! Yahweh , we beg you , send prosperity now . 

$ 18:118:26 Blessed is he who comes in Yahweh's name ! We have blessed you out of Yahweh's house . 

$ 18:118:27 Yahweh is God , and he has given us light . Bind the sacrifice with cords , even to the horns of the altar . 

$ 18:118:28 You are my God , and I will give thanks to you . You are my God , I will exalt you . 

$ 18:118:29 Oh give thanks to Yahweh , for he is good , for his loving kindness endures forever . 


$ 18:119:1 Blessed are those whose ways are blameless , who walk according to Yahweh's law . 

$ 18:119:2 Blessed are those who keep his statutes , who seek him with their whole heart . 

$ 18:119:3 Yes , they do nothing wrong . They walk in his ways . 

$ 18:119:4 You have commanded your precepts , that we should fully obey them . 

$ 18:119:5 Oh that my ways were steadfast to obey your statutes ! 

$ 18:119:6 Then I wouldn't be disappointed , when I consider all of your commandments . 

$ 18:119:7 I will give thanks to you with uprightness of heart , when I learn your righteous judgments . 

$ 18:119:8 I will observe your statutes . Don't utterly forsake me . 

$ 18:119:9 How can a young man keep his way pure ? By living according to your word . 

$ 18:119:10 With my whole heart , I have sought you . Don't let me wander from your commandments . 

$ 18:119:11 I have hidden your word in my heart , that I might not sin against you . 

$ 18:119:12 Blessed are you , Yahweh . Teach me your statutes . 

$ 18:119:13 With my lips , I have declared all the ordinances of your mouth . 

$ 18:119:14 I have rejoiced in the way of your testimonies , as much as in all riches . 

$ 18:119:15 I will meditate on your precepts , and consider your ways . 

$ 18:119:16 I will delight myself in your statutes . I will not forget your word . 

$ 18:119:17 Do good to your servant . I will live and I will obey your word . 

$ 18:119:18 Open my eyes , that I may see wondrous things out of your law . 

$ 18:119:19 I am a stranger on the earth . Don't hide your commandments from me . 

$ 18:119:20 My soul is consumed with longing for your ordinances at all times . 

$ 18:119:21 You have rebuked the proud who are cursed , who wander from your commandments . 

$ 18:119:22 Take reproach and contempt away from me , for I have kept your statutes . 

$ 18:119:23 Though princes sit and slander me , your servant will meditate on your statutes . 

$ 18:119:24 Indeed your statutes are my delight , and my counselors . 

$ 18:119:25 My soul is laid low in the dust . Revive me according to your word ! 

$ 18:119:26 I declared my ways , and you answered me . Teach me your statutes . 

$ 18:119:27 Let me understand the teaching of your precepts ! Then I will meditate on your wondrous works . 

$ 18:119:28 My soul is weary with sorrow : strengthen me according to your word . 

$ 18:119:29 Keep me from the way of deceit . Grant me your law graciously ! 

$ 18:119:30 I have chosen the way of truth . I have set your ordinances before me . 

$ 18:119:31 I cling to your statutes , Yahweh . Don't let me be disappointed . 

$ 18:119:32 I run in the path of your commandments , for you have set my heart free . 

$ 18:119:33 Teach me , Yahweh , the way of your statutes . I will keep them to the end . 

$ 18:119:34 Give me understanding , and I will keep your law . Yes , I will obey it with my whole heart . 

$ 18:119:35 Direct me in the path of your commandments , for I delight in them . 

$ 18:119:36 Turn my heart toward your statutes , not toward selfish gain . 

$ 18:119:37 Turn my eyes away from looking at worthless things . Revive me in your ways . 

$ 18:119:38 Fulfill your promise to your servant , that you may be feared . 

$ 18:119:39 Take away my disgrace that I dread , for your ordinances are good . 

$ 18:119:40 Behold , I long for your precepts ! Revive me in your righteousness . 

$ 18:119:41 Let your loving kindness also come to me , Yahweh , your salvation , according to your word . 

$ 18:119:42 So I will have an answer for him who reproaches me , for I trust in your word . 

$ 18:119:43 Don't snatch the word of truth out of my mouth , for I put my hope in your ordinances . 

$ 18:119:44 So I will obey your law continually , forever and ever . 

$ 18:119:45 I will walk in liberty , for I have sought your precepts . 

$ 18:119:46 I will also speak of your statutes before kings , and will not be disappointed . 

$ 18:119:47 I will delight myself in your commandments , because I love them . 

$ 18:119:48 I reach out my hands for your commandments , which I love . I will meditate on your statutes . 

$ 18:119:49 Remember your word to your servant , because you gave me hope . 

$ 18:119:50 This is my comfort in my affliction , for your word has revived me . 

$ 18:119:51 The arrogant mock me excessively , but I don't swerve from your law . 

$ 18:119:52 I remember your ordinances of old , Yahweh , and have comforted myself . 

$ 18:119:53 Indignation has taken hold on me , because of the wicked who forsake your law . 

$ 18:119:54 Your statutes have been my songs , in the house where I live . 

$ 18:119:55 I have remembered your name , Yahweh , in the night , and I obey your law . 

$ 18:119:56 This is my way , that I keep your precepts . 

$ 18:119:57 Yahweh is my portion . I promised to obey your words . 

$ 18:119:58 I sought your favor with my whole heart . Be merciful to me according to your word . 

$ 18:119:59 I considered my ways , and turned my steps to your statutes . 

$ 18:119:60 I will hurry , and not delay , to obey your commandments . 

$ 18:119:61 The ropes of the wicked bind me , but I won't forget your law . 

$ 18:119:62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks to you , because of your righteous ordinances . 

$ 18:119:63 I am a friend of all those who fear you , of those who observe your precepts . 

$ 18:119:64 The earth is full of your loving kindness , Yahweh . Teach me your statutes . 

$ 18:119:65 Do good to your servant , according to your word , Yahweh . 

$ 18:119:66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge , for I believe in your commandments . 

$ 18:119:67 Before I was afflicted , I went astray ; but now I observe your word . 

$ 18:119:68 You are good , and do good . Teach me your statutes . 

$ 18:119:69 The proud have smeared a lie upon me . With my whole heart , I will keep your precepts . 

$ 18:119:70 Their heart is as callous as the fat , but I delight in your law . 

$ 18:119:71 It is good for me that I have been afflicted , that I may learn your statutes . 

$ 18:119:72 The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of pieces of gold and silver . 

$ 18:119:73 Your hands have made me and formed me . Give me understanding , that I may learn your commandments . 

$ 18:119:74 Those who fear you will see me and be glad , because I have put my hope in your word . 

$ 18:119:75 Yahweh , I know that your judgments are righteous , that in faithfulness you have afflicted me . 

$ 18:119:76 Please let your loving kindness be for my comfort , according to your word to your servant . 

$ 18:119:77 Let your tender mercies come to me , that I may live ; for your law is my delight . 

$ 18:119:78 Let the proud be disappointed , for they have overthrown me wrongfully . I will meditate on your precepts . 

$ 18:119:79 Let those who fear you turn to me . They will know your statutes . 

$ 18:119:80 Let my heart be blameless toward your decrees , that I may not be disappointed . 

$ 18:119:81 My soul faints for your salvation . I hope in your word . 

$ 18:119:82 My eyes fail for your word . I say , <" When will you comfort me ? >" 

$ 18:119:83 For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke . I don't forget your statutes . 

$ 18:119:84 How many are the days of your servant ? When will you execute judgment on those who persecute me ? 

$ 18:119:85 The proud have dug pits for me , contrary to your law . 

$ 18:119:86 All of your commandments are faithful . They persecute me wrongfully . Help me ! 

$ 18:119:87 They had almost wiped me from the earth , but I didn't forsake your precepts . 

$ 18:119:88 Preserve my life according to your loving kindness , so I will obey the statutes of your mouth . 

$ 18:119:89 Yahweh , your word is settled in heaven forever . 

$ 18:119:90 Your faithfulness is to all generations . You have established the earth , and it remains . 

$ 18:119:91 Your laws remain to this day , for all things serve you . 

$ 18:119:92 Unless your law had been my delight , I would have perished in my affliction . 

$ 18:119:93 I will never forget your precepts , for with them , you have revived me . 

$ 18:119:94 I am yours . Save me , for I have sought your precepts . 

$ 18:119:95 The wicked have waited for me , to destroy me . I will consider your statutes . 

$ 18:119:96 I have seen a limit to all perfection , but your commands are boundless . 

$ 18:119:97 How I love your law ! It is my meditation all day . 

$ 18:119:98 Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies , for your commandments are always with me . 

$ 18:119:99 I have more understanding than all my teachers , for your testimonies are my meditation . 

$ 18:119:100 I understand more than the aged , because I have kept your precepts . 

$ 18:119:101 I have kept my feet from every evil way , that I might observe your word . 

$ 18:119:102 I have not turned away from your ordinances , for you have taught me . 

$ 18:119:103 How sweet are your promises to my taste , more than honey to my mouth ! 

$ 18:119:104 Through your precepts , I get understanding ; therefore I hate every false way . 

$ 18:119:105 Your word is a lamp to my feet , and a light for my path . 

$ 18:119:106 I have sworn , and have confirmed it , that I will obey your righteous ordinances . 

$ 18:119:107 I am afflicted very much . Revive me , Yahweh , according to your word . 

$ 18:119:108 Accept , I beg you , the willing offerings of my mouth . Yahweh , teach me your ordinances . 

$ 18:119:109 My soul is continually in my hand , yet I won't forget your law . 

$ 18:119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me , yet I haven't gone astray from your precepts . 

$ 18:119:111 I have taken your testimonies as a heritage forever , for they are the joy of my heart . 

$ 18:119:112 I have set my heart to perform your statutes forever , even to the end . 

$ 18:119:113 I hate double - minded men , but I love your law . 

$ 18:119:114 You are my hiding place and my shield . I hope in your word . 

$ 18:119:115 Depart from me , you evildoers , that I may keep the commandments of my God . 

$ 18:119:116 Uphold me according to your word , that I may live . Let me not be ashamed of my hope . 

$ 18:119:117 Hold me up , and I will be safe , and will have respect for your statutes continually . 

$ 18:119:118 You reject all those who stray from your statutes , for their deceit is in vain . 

$ 18:119:119 You put away all the wicked of the earth like dross . Therefore I love your testimonies . 

$ 18:119:120 My flesh trembles for fear of you . I am afraid of your judgments . 

$ 18:119:121 I have done what is just and righteous . Don't leave me to my oppressors . 

$ 18:119:122 Ensure your servant's well - being . Don't let the proud oppress me . 

$ 18:119:123 My eyes fail looking for your salvation , for your righteous word . 

$ 18:119:124 Deal with your servant according to your loving kindness . Teach me your statutes . 

$ 18:119:125 I am your servant . Give me understanding , that I may know your testimonies . 

$ 18:119:126 It is time to act , Yahweh , for they break your law . 

$ 18:119:127 Therefore I love your commandments more than gold , yes , more than pure gold . 

$ 18:119:128 Therefore I consider all of your precepts to be right . I hate every false way . 

$ 18:119:129 Your testimonies are wonderful , therefore my soul keeps them . 

$ 18:119:130 The entrance of your words gives light . It gives understanding to the simple . 

$ 18:119:131 I opened my mouth wide and panted , for I longed for your commandments . 

$ 18:119:132 Turn to me , and have mercy on me , as you always do to those who love your name . 

$ 18:119:133 Establish my footsteps in your word . Don't let any iniquity have dominion over me . 

$ 18:119:134 Redeem me from the oppression of man , so I will observe your precepts . 

$ 18:119:135 Make your face shine on your servant . Teach me your statutes . 

$ 18:119:136 Streams of tears run down my eyes , because they don't observe your law . 

$ 18:119:137 You are righteous , Yahweh . Your judgments are upright . 

$ 18:119:138 You have commanded your statutes in righteousness . They are fully trustworthy . 

$ 18:119:139 My zeal wears me out , because my enemies ignore your words . 

$ 18:119:140 Your promises have been thoroughly tested , and your servant loves them . 

$ 18:119:141 I am small and despised . I don't forget your precepts . 

$ 18:119:142 Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness . Your law is truth . 

$ 18:119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold of me . Your commandments are my delight . 

$ 18:119:144 Your testimonies are righteous forever . Give me understanding , that I may live . 

$ 18:119:145 I have called with my whole heart . Answer me , Yahweh ! I will keep your statutes . 

$ 18:119:146 I have called to you . Save me ! I will obey your statutes . 

$ 18:119:147 I rise before dawn and cry for help . I put my hope in your words . 

$ 18:119:148 My eyes stay open through the night watches , that I might meditate on your word . 

$ 18:119:149 Hear my voice according to your loving kindness . Revive me , Yahweh , according to your ordinances . 

$ 18:119:150 They draw near who follow after wickedness . They are far from your law . 

$ 18:119:151 You are near , Yahweh . All your commandments are truth . 

$ 18:119:152 Of old I have known from your testimonies , that you have founded them forever . 

$ 18:119:153 Consider my affliction , and deliver me , for I don't forget your law . 

$ 18:119:154 Plead my cause , and redeem me ! Revive me according to your promise . 

$ 18:119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked , for they don't seek your statutes . 

$ 18:119:156 Great are your tender mercies , Yahweh . Revive me according to your ordinances . 

$ 18:119:157 Many are my persecutors and my adversaries . I haven't swerved from your testimonies . 

$ 18:119:158 I look at the faithless with loathing , because they don't observe your word . 

$ 18:119:159 Consider how I love your precepts . Revive me , Yahweh , according to your loving kindness . 

$ 18:119:160 All of your words are truth . Every one of your righteous ordinances endures forever . 

$ 18:119:161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause , but my heart stands in awe of your words . 

$ 18:119:162 I rejoice at your word , as one who finds great plunder . 

$ 18:119:163 I hate and abhor falsehood . I love your law . 

$ 18:119:164 Seven times a day , I praise you , because of your righteous ordinances . 

$ 18:119:165 Those who love your law have great peace . Nothing causes them to stumble . 

$ 18:119:166 I have hoped for your salvation , Yahweh . I have done your commandments . 

$ 18:119:167 My soul has observed your testimonies . I love them exceedingly . 

$ 18:119:168 I have obeyed your precepts and your testimonies , for all my ways are before you . 

$ 18:119:169 Let my cry come before you , Yahweh . Give me understanding according to your word . 

$ 18:119:170 Let my supplication come before you . Deliver me according to your word . 

$ 18:119:171 Let my lips utter praise , for you teach me your statutes . 

$ 18:119:172 Let my tongue sing of your word , for all your commandments are righteousness . 

$ 18:119:173 Let your hand be ready to help me , for I have chosen your precepts . 

$ 18:119:174 I have longed for your salvation , Yahweh . Your law is my delight . 

$ 18:119:175 Let my soul live , that I may praise you . Let your ordinances help me . 

$ 18:119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep . Seek your servant , for I don't forget your commandments . 


$ 18:120:1 In my distress , I cried to Yahweh . He answered me . 

$ 18:120:2 Deliver my soul , Yahweh , from lying lips , from a deceitful tongue . 

$ 18:120:3 What will be given to you , and what will be done more to you , you deceitful tongue ? 

$ 18:120:4 Sharp arrows of the mighty , with coals of juniper . 

$ 18:120:5 Woe is me , that I live in Meshech , that I dwell among the tents of Kedar ! 

$ 18:120:6 My soul has had her dwelling too long with him who hates peace . 

$ 18:120:7 I am for peace , but when I speak , they are for war . 


$ 18:121:1 I will lift up my eyes to the hills . Where does my help come from ? 

$ 18:121:2 My help comes from Yahweh , who made heaven and earth . 

$ 18:121:3 He will not allow your foot to be moved . He who keeps you will not slumber . 

$ 18:121:4 Behold , he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep . 

$ 18:121:5 Yahweh is your keeper . Yahweh is your shade on your right hand . 

$ 18:121:6 The sun will not harm you by day , nor the moon by night . 

$ 18:121:7 Yahweh will keep you from all evil . He will keep your soul . 

$ 18:121:8 Yahweh will keep your going out and your coming in , from this time forward , and forever more . 


$ 18:122:1 I was glad when they said to me , <" Let's go to Yahweh's house ! >" 

$ 18:122:2 Our feet are standing within your gates , Jerusalem ; 

$ 18:122:3 Jerusalem , that is built as a city that is compact together ; 

$ 18:122:4 where the tribes go up , even Yah's tribes , according to an ordinance for Israel , to give thanks to Yahweh's name . 

$ 18:122:5 For there are set thrones for judgment , the thrones of David's house . 

$ 18:122:6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem . Those who love you will prosper . 

$ 18:122:7 Peace be within your walls , and prosperity within your palaces . 

$ 18:122:8 For my brothers' and companions' sakes , I will now say , <" Peace be within you . >" 

$ 18:122:9 For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God , I will seek your good . 


$ 18:123:1 To you I do lift up my eyes , you who sit in the heavens . 

$ 18:123:2 Behold , as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master , as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress ; so our eyes look to Yahweh , our God , until he has mercy on us . 

$ 18:123:3 Have mercy on us , Yahweh , have mercy on us , for we have endured much contempt . 

$ 18:123:4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease , with the contempt of the proud . 


$ 18:124:1 If it had not been Yahweh who was on our side , let Israel now say , 

$ 18:124:2 if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side , when men rose up against us ; 

$ 18:124:3 then they would have swallowed us up alive , when their wrath was kindled against us ; 

$ 18:124:4 then the waters would have overwhelmed us , the stream would have gone over our soul ; 

$ 18:124:5 then the proud waters would have gone over our soul . 

$ 18:124:6 Blessed be Yahweh , who has not given us as a prey to their teeth . 

$ 18:124:7 Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler's snare . The snare is broken , and we have escaped . 

$ 18:124:8 Our help is in Yahweh's name , who made heaven and earth . 


$ 18:125:1 Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion , which can't be moved , but remains forever . 

$ 18:125:2 As the mountains surround Jerusalem , so Yahweh surrounds his people from this time forward and forever more . 

$ 18:125:3 For the scepter of wickedness won't remain over the allotment of the righteous ; so that the righteous won't use their hands to do evil . 

$ 18:125:4 Do good , Yahweh , to those who are good , to those who are upright in their hearts . 

$ 18:125:5 But as for those who turn away to their crooked ways , Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity . Peace be on Israel . 


$ 18:126:1 When Yahweh brought back those who returned to Zion , we were like those who dream . 

$ 18:126:2 Then our mouth was filled with laughter , and our tongue with singing . Then they said among the nations , <" Yahweh has done great things for them . >" 

$ 18:126:3 Yahweh has done great things for us , and we are glad . 

$ 18:126:4 Restore our fortunes again , Yahweh , like the streams in the Negev . 

$ 18:126:5 Those who sow in tears will reap in joy . 

$ 18:126:6 He who goes out weeping , carrying seed for sowing , will certainly come again with joy , carrying his sheaves . 


$ 18:127:1 Unless Yahweh builds the house , they labor in vain who build it . Unless Yahweh watches over the city , the watchman guards it in vain . 

$ 18:127:2 It is vain for you to rise up early , to stay up late , eating the bread of toil ; for he gives sleep to his loved ones . 

$ 18:127:3 Behold , children are a heritage of Yahweh . The fruit of the womb is his reward . 

$ 18:127:4 As arrows in the hand of a mighty man , so are the children of youth . 

$ 18:127:5 Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them . They won't be disappointed when they speak with their enemies in the gate . 


$ 18:128:1 Blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh , who walks in his ways . 

$ 18:128:2 For you will eat the labor of your hands . You will be happy , and it will be well with you . 

$ 18:128:3 Your wife will be as a fruitful vine , in the innermost parts of your house ; your children like olive plants , around your table . 

$ 18:128:4 Behold , thus is the man blessed who fears Yahweh . 

$ 18:128:5 May Yahweh bless you out of Zion , and may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life . 

$ 18:128:6 Yes , may you see your children's children . Peace be upon Israel . 


$ 18:129:1 Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up . Let Israel now say , 

$ 18:129:2 many times they have afflicted me from my youth up , yet they have not prevailed against me . 

$ 18:129:3 The plowers plowed on my back . They made their furrows long . 

$ 18:129:4 Yahweh is righteous . He has cut apart the cords of the wicked . 

$ 18:129:5 Let them be disappointed and turned backward , all those who hate Zion . 

$ 18:129:6 Let them be as the grass on the housetops , which withers before it grows up ; 

$ 18:129:7 with which the reaper doesn't fill his hand , nor he who binds sheaves , his bosom . 

$ 18:129:8 Neither do those who go by say , <" The blessing of Yahweh be on you . We bless you in Yahweh's name . >" 


$ 18:130:1 Out of the depths I have cried to you , Yahweh . 

$ 18:130:2 Lord , hear my voice . Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my petitions . 

$ 18:130:3 If you , Yah , kept a record of sins , Lord , who could stand ? 

$ 18:130:4 But there is forgiveness with you , therefore you are feared . 

$ 18:130:5 I wait for Yahweh . My soul waits . I hope in his word . 

$ 18:130:6 My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the morning ; more than watchmen for the morning . 

$ 18:130:7 Israel , hope in Yahweh , for with Yahweh there is loving kindness . With him is abundant redemption . 

$ 18:130:8 He will redeem Israel from all their sins . 


$ 18:131:1 Yahweh , my heart isn't arrogant , nor my eyes lofty ; nor do I concern myself with great matters , or things too wonderful for me . 

$ 18:131:2 Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul , like a weaned child with his mother , like a weaned child is my soul within me . 

$ 18:131:3 Israel , hope in Yahweh , from this time forward and forever more . 


$ 18:132:1 Yahweh , remember David and all his affliction , 

$ 18:132:2 how he swore to Yahweh , and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob : 

$ 18:132:3 <" Surely I will not come into the structure of my house , nor go up into my bed ; 

$ 18:132:4 I will not give sleep to my eyes , or slumber to my eyelids ; 

$ 18:132:5 until I find out a place for Yahweh , a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob . >" 

$ 18:132:6 Behold , we heard of it in Ephrathah . We found it in the field of Jaar : 

$ 18:132:7 <" We will go into his dwelling place . We will worship at his footstool . 

$ 18:132:8 Arise , Yahweh , into your resting place ; you , and the ark of your strength . 

$ 18:132:9 Let your priests be clothed with righteousness . Let your saints shout for joy ! >" 

$ 18:132:10 For your servant David's sake , don't turn away the face of your anointed one . 

$ 18:132:11 Yahweh has sworn to David in truth . He will not turn from it : <" I will set the fruit of your body on your throne . 

$ 18:132:12 If your children will keep my covenant , my testimony that I will teach them , their children also will sit on your throne forever more . >" 

$ 18:132:13 For Yahweh has chosen Zion . He has desired it for his habitation . 

$ 18:132:14 <" This is my resting place forever . Here I will live , for I have desired it . 

$ 18:132:15 I will abundantly bless her provision . I will satisfy her poor with bread . 

$ 18:132:16 Her priests I will also clothe with salvation . Her saints will shout aloud for joy . 

$ 18:132:17 There I will make the horn of David to bud . I have ordained a lamp for my anointed . 

$ 18:132:18 I will clothe his enemies with shame , but on himself , his crown will be resplendent . >" 


$ 18:133:1 See how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to live together in unity ! 

$ 18:133:2 It is like the precious oil on the head , that ran down on the beard , even Aaron's beard ; that came down on the edge of his robes ; 

$ 18:133:3 like the dew of Hermon , that comes down on the hills of Zion : for there Yahweh gives the blessing , even life forever more . 


$ 18:134:1 Look ! Praise Yahweh , all you servants of Yahweh , who stand by night in Yahweh's house ! 

$ 18:134:2 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary . Praise Yahweh ! 

$ 18:134:3 May Yahweh bless you from Zion ; even he who made heaven and earth . 


$ 18:135:1 Praise Yah ! Praise Yahweh's name ! Praise him , you servants of Yahweh , 

$ 18:135:2 you who stand in Yahweh's house , in the courts of our God's house . 

$ 18:135:3 Praise Yah , for Yahweh is good . Sing praises to his name , for that is pleasant . 

$ 18:135:4 For Yah has chosen Jacob for himself ; Israel for his own possession . 

$ 18:135:5 For I know that Yahweh is great , that our Lord is above all gods . 

$ 18:135:6 Whatever Yahweh pleased , that he has done , in heaven and in earth , in the seas and in all deeps ; 

$ 18:135:7 who causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth ; who makes lightnings with the rain ; who brings the wind out of his treasuries ; 

$ 18:135:8 Who struck the firstborn of Egypt , both of man and animal ; 

$ 18:135:9 Who sent signs and wonders into the middle of you , Egypt , on Pharaoh , and on all his servants ; 

$ 18:135:10 who struck many nations , and killed mighty kings , 

$ 18:135:11 Sihon king of the Amorites , Og king of Bashan , and all the kingdoms of Canaan , 

$ 18:135:12 and gave their land for a heritage , a heritage to Israel , his people . 

$ 18:135:13 Your name , Yahweh , endures forever ; your renown , Yahweh , throughout all generations . 

$ 18:135:14 For Yahweh will judge his people , and have compassion on his servants . 

$ 18:135:15 The idols of the nations are silver and gold , the work of men's hands . 

$ 18:135:16 They have mouths , but they can't speak . They have eyes , but they can't see . 

$ 18:135:17 They have ears , but they can't hear ; neither is there any breath in their mouths . 

$ 18:135:18 Those who make them will be like them ; yes , everyone who trusts in them . 

$ 18:135:19 House of Israel , praise Yahweh ! House of Aaron , praise Yahweh ! 

$ 18:135:20 House of Levi , praise Yahweh ! You who fear Yahweh , praise Yahweh ! 

$ 18:135:21 Blessed be Yahweh from Zion , Who dwells at Jerusalem . Praise Yah ! 


$ 18:136:1 Give thanks to Yahweh , for he is good ; for his loving kindness endures forever . 

$ 18:136:2 Give thanks to the God of gods ; for his loving kindness endures forever . 

$ 18:136:3 Give thanks to the Lord of lords ; for his loving kindness endures forever : 

$ 18:136:4 To him who alone does great wonders ; for his loving kindness endures forever : 

$ 18:136:5 To him who by understanding made the heavens ; for his loving kindness endures forever : 

$ 18:136:6 To him who spread out the earth above the waters ; for his loving kindness endures forever : 

$ 18:136:7 To him who made the great lights ; for his loving kindness endures forever : 

$ 18:136:8 The sun to rule by day ; for his loving kindness endures forever ; 

$ 18:136:9 The moon and stars to rule by night ; for his loving kindness endures forever : 

$ 18:136:10 To him who struck down the Egyptian firstborn ; for his loving kindness endures forever ; 

$ 18:136:11 And brought out Israel from among them ; for his loving kindness endures forever ; 

$ 18:136:12 With a strong hand , and with an outstretched arm ; for his loving kindness endures forever : 

$ 18:136:13 To him who divided the Red Sea apart ; for his loving kindness endures forever ; 

$ 18:136:14 And made Israel to pass through the middle of it ; for his loving kindness endures forever ; 

$ 18:136:15 But overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea ; for his loving kindness endures forever : 

$ 18:136:16 To him who led his people through the wilderness ; for his loving kindness endures forever : 

$ 18:136:17 To him who struck great kings ; for his loving kindness endures forever ; 

$ 18:136:18 And killed mighty kings ; for his loving kindness endures forever : 

$ 18:136:19 Sihon king of the Amorites ; for his loving kindness endures forever ; 

$ 18:136:20 Og king of Bashan ; for his loving kindness endures forever ; 

$ 18:136:21 And gave their land as an inheritance ; for his loving kindness endures forever ; 

$ 18:136:22 Even a heritage to Israel his servant ; for his loving kindness endures forever : 

$ 18:136:23 Who remembered us in our low estate ; for his loving kindness endures forever ; 

$ 18:136:24 And has delivered us from our adversaries ; for his loving kindness endures forever : 

$ 18:136:25 Who gives food to every creature ; for his loving kindness endures forever . 

$ 18:136:26 Oh give thanks to the God of heaven ; for his loving kindness endures forever . 


$ 18:137:1 By the rivers of Babylon , there we sat down . Yes , we wept , when we remembered Zion . 

$ 18:137:2 On the willows in that land , we hung up our harps . 

$ 18:137:3 For there , those who led us captive asked us for songs . Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy : <" Sing us one of the songs of Zion ! >" 

$ 18:137:4 How can we sing Yahweh's song in a foreign land ? 

$ 18:137:5 If I forget you , Jerusalem , let my right hand forget its skill . 

$ 18:137:6 Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don't remember you ; if I don't prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy . 

$ 18:137:7 Remember , Yahweh , against the children of Edom , the day of Jerusalem ; who said , <" Raze it ! Raze it even to its foundation ! >" 

$ 18:137:8 Daughter of Babylon , doomed to destruction , he will be happy who rewards you , as you have served us . 

$ 18:137:9 Happy shall he be , who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock . 


$ 18:138:1 I will give you thanks with my whole heart . Before the gods , I will sing praises to you . 

$ 18:138:2 I will bow down toward your holy temple , and give thanks to your Name for your loving kindness and for your truth ; for you have exalted your Name and your Word above all . 

$ 18:138:3 In the day that I called , you answered me . You encouraged me with strength in my soul . 

$ 18:138:4 All the kings of the earth will give you thanks , Yahweh , for they have heard the words of your mouth . 

$ 18:138:5 Yes , they will sing of the ways of Yahweh ; for great is Yahweh's glory . 

$ 18:138:6 For though Yahweh is high , yet he looks after the lowly ; but the proud , he knows from afar . 

$ 18:138:7 Though I walk in the middle of trouble , you will revive me . You will stretch out your hand against the wrath of my enemies . Your right hand will save me . 

$ 18:138:8 Yahweh will fulfill that which concerns me ; your loving kindness , Yahweh , endures forever . Don't forsake the works of your own hands . 


$ 18:139:1 Yahweh , you have searched me , and you know me . 

$ 18:139:2 You know my sitting down and my rising up . You perceive my thoughts from afar . 

$ 18:139:3 You search out my path and my lying down , and are acquainted with all my ways . 

$ 18:139:4 For there is not a word on my tongue , but , behold , Yahweh , you know it altogether . 

$ 18:139:5 You hem me in behind and before . You laid your hand on me . 

$ 18:139:6 This knowledge is beyond me . It's lofty . I can't attain it . 

$ 18:139:7 Where could I go from your Spirit ? Or where could I flee from your presence ? 

$ 18:139:8 If I ascend up into heaven , you are there . If I make my bed in Sheol , behold , you are there ! 

$ 18:139:9 If I take the wings of the dawn , and settle in the uttermost parts of the sea ; 

$ 18:139:10 Even there your hand will lead me , and your right hand will hold me . 

$ 18:139:11 If I say , <" Surely the darkness will overwhelm me ; the light around me will be night ; >" 

$ 18:139:12 even the darkness doesn't hide from you , but the night shines as the day . The darkness is like light to you . 

$ 18:139:13 For you formed my inmost being . You knit me together in my mother's womb . 

$ 18:139:14 I will give thanks to you , for I am fearfully and wonderfully made . Your works are wonderful . My soul knows that very well . 

$ 18:139:15 My frame wasn't hidden from you , when I was made in secret , woven together in the depths of the earth . 

$ 18:139:16 Your eyes saw my body . In your book they were all written , the days that were ordained for me , when as yet there were none of them . 

$ 18:139:17 How precious to me are your thoughts , God ! How vast is their sum ! 

$ 18:139:18 If I would count them , they are more in number than the sand . When I wake up , I am still with you . 

$ 18:139:19 If only you , God , would kill the wicked . Get away from me , you bloodthirsty men ! 

$ 18:139:20 For they speak against you wickedly . Your enemies take your name in vain . 

$ 18:139:21 Yahweh , don't I hate those who hate you ? Am I not grieved with those who rise up against you ? 

$ 18:139:22 I hate them with perfect hatred . They have become my enemies . 

$ 18:139:23 Search me , God , and know my heart . Try me , and know my thoughts . 

$ 18:139:24 See if there is any wicked way in me , and lead me in the everlasting way . 


$ 18:140:1 Deliver me , Yahweh , from the evil man . Preserve me from the violent man ; 

$ 18:140:2 those who devise mischief in their hearts . They continually gather themselves together for war . 

$ 18:140:3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent . Viper's poison is under their lips . Selah . 

$ 18:140:4 Yahweh , keep me from the hands of the wicked . Preserve me from the violent men who have determined to trip my feet . 

$ 18:140:5 The proud have hidden a snare for me , they have spread the cords of a net by the path . They have set traps for me . Selah . 

$ 18:140:6 I said to Yahweh , <" You are my God . >" Listen to the cry of my petitions , Yahweh . 

$ 18:140:7 Yahweh , the Lord , the strength of my salvation , you have covered my head in the day of battle . 

$ 18:140:8 Yahweh , don't grant the desires of the wicked . Don't let their evil plans succeed , or they will become proud . Selah . 

$ 18:140:9 As for the head of those who surround me , let the mischief of their own lips cover them . 

$ 18:140:10 Let burning coals fall on them . Let them be thrown into the fire , into miry pits , from where they never rise . 

$ 18:140:11 An evil speaker won't be established in the earth . Evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him . 

$ 18:140:12 I know that Yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted , and justice for the needy . 

$ 18:140:13 Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name . The upright will dwell in your presence . 


$ 18:141:1 Yahweh , I have called on you . Come to me quickly ! Listen to my voice when I call to you . 

$ 18:141:2 Let my prayer be set before you like incense ; the lifting up of my hands like the evening sacrifice . 

$ 18:141:3 Set a watch , Yahweh , before my mouth . Keep the door of my lips . 

$ 18:141:4 Don't incline my heart to any evil thing , to practice deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity . Don't let me eat of their delicacies . 

$ 18:141:5 Let the righteous strike me , it is kindness ; let him reprove me , it is like oil on the head ; don't let my head refuse it ; Yet my prayer is always against evil deeds . 

$ 18:141:6 Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock . They will hear my words , for they are well spoken . 

$ 18:141:7 <" As when one plows and breaks up the earth , our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol . >" 

$ 18:141:8 For my eyes are on you , Yahweh , the Lord . In you , I take refuge . Don't leave my soul destitute . 

$ 18:141:9 Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me , from the traps of the workers of iniquity . 

$ 18:141:10 Let the wicked fall together into their own nets , while I pass by . 


$ 18:142:1 I cry with my voice to Yahweh . With my voice , I ask Yahweh for mercy . 

$ 18:142:2 I pour out my complaint before him . I tell him my troubles . 

$ 18:142:3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me , you knew my route . On the path in which I walk , they have hidden a snare for me . 

$ 18:142:4 Look on my right , and see ; for there is no one who is concerned for me . Refuge has fled from me . No one cares for my soul . 

$ 18:142:5 I cried to you , Yahweh . I said , <" You are my refuge , my portion in the land of the living . >" 

$ 18:142:6 Listen to my cry , for I am in desperate need . deliver me from my persecutors , For they are stronger than me . 

$ 18:142:7 Bring my soul out of prison , that I may give thanks to your name . The righteous will surround me , for you will be good to me . 


$ 18:143:1 Hear my prayer , Yahweh . Listen to my petitions . In your faithfulness and righteousness , relieve me . 

$ 18:143:2 Don't enter into judgment with your servant , for in your sight no man living is righteous . 

$ 18:143:3 For the enemy pursues my soul . He has struck my life down to the ground . He has made me live in dark places , as those who have been long dead . 

$ 18:143:4 Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me . My heart within me is desolate . 

$ 18:143:5 I remember the days of old . I meditate on all your doings . I contemplate the work of your hands . 

$ 18:143:6 I spread out my hands to you . My soul thirsts for you , like a parched land . Selah . 

$ 18:143:7 Hurry to answer me , Yahweh . My spirit fails . Don't hide your face from me , so that I don't become like those who go down into the pit . 

$ 18:143:8 Cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning , for I trust in you . Cause me to know the way in which I should walk , for I lift up my soul to you . 

$ 18:143:9 Deliver me , Yahweh , from my enemies . I flee to you to hide me . 

$ 18:143:10 Teach me to do your will , for you are my God . Your Spirit is good . Lead me in the land of uprightness . 

$ 18:143:11 Revive me , Yahweh , for your name's sake . In your righteousness , bring my soul out of trouble . 

$ 18:143:12 In your loving kindness , cut off my enemies , and destroy all those who afflict my soul , For I am your servant . 


$ 18:144:1 Blessed be Yahweh , my rock , who teaches my hands to war , and my fingers to battle : 

$ 18:144:2 my loving kindness , my fortress , my high tower , my deliverer , my shield , and he in whom I take refuge ; who subdues my people under me . 

$ 18:144:3 Yahweh , what is man , that you care for him ? Or the son of man , that you think of him ? 

$ 18:144:4 Man is like a breath . His days are like a shadow that passes away . 

$ 18:144:5 Part your heavens , Yahweh , and come down . Touch the mountains , and they will smoke . 

$ 18:144:6 Throw out lightning , and scatter them . Send out your arrows , and rout them . 

$ 18:144:7 Stretch out your hand from above , rescue me , and deliver me out of great waters , out of the hands of foreigners ; 

$ 18:144:8 whose mouths speak deceit , Whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood . 

$ 18:144:9 I will sing a new song to you , God . On a ten - stringed lyre , I will sing praises to you . 

$ 18:144:10 You are he who gives salvation to kings , who rescues David , his servant , from the deadly sword . 

$ 18:144:11 Rescue me , and deliver me out of the hands of foreigners , whose mouths speak deceit , whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood . 

$ 18:144:12 Then our sons will be like well - nurtured plants , our daughters like pillars carved to adorn a palace . 

$ 18:144:13 Our barns are full , filled with all kinds of provision . Our sheep produce thousands and ten thousands in our fields . 

$ 18:144:14 Our oxen will pull heavy loads . There is no breaking in , and no going away , and no outcry in our streets . 

$ 18:144:15 Happy are the people who are in such a situation . Happy are the people whose God is Yahweh . 
with a consecutive letter of the Hebrew alphabet . 

$ 18:145:1 Yahweh upholds all who fall , and raises up all those who are bowed down . 

$ 18:145:2 The eyes of all wait for you . You give them their food in due season . 

$ 18:145:3 You open your hand , and satisfy the desire of every living thing . 

$ 18:145:4 Yahweh is righteous in all his ways , and gracious in all his works . 

$ 18:145:5 Yahweh is near to all those who call on him , to all who call on him in truth . 

$ 18:145:6 He will fulfill the desire of those who fear him . He also will hear their cry , and will save them . 

$ 18:145:7 Yahweh preserves all those who love him , but all the wicked he will destroy . 

$ 18:145:8 My mouth will speak the praise of Yahweh . Let all flesh bless his holy name forever and ever . 


$ 18:146:1 Praise Yah ! Praise Yahweh , my soul . 

$ 18:146:2 While I live , I will praise Yahweh . I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist . 

$ 18:146:3 Don't put your trust in princes , each a son of man in whom there is no help . 

$ 18:146:4 His spirit departs , and he returns to the earth . In that very day , his thoughts perish . 

$ 18:146:5 Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help , whose hope is in Yahweh , his God : 

$ 18:146:6 who made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that is in them ; who keeps truth forever ; 

$ 18:146:7 who executes justice for the oppressed ; who gives food to the hungry . Yahweh frees the prisoners . 

$ 18:146:8 Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind . Yahweh raises up those who are bowed down . Yahweh loves the righteous . 

$ 18:146:9 Yahweh preserves the foreigners . He upholds the fatherless and widow , but the way of the wicked he turns upside down . 

$ 18:146:10 Yahweh will reign forever ; your God , O Zion , to all generations . Praise Yah ! 


$ 18:147:1 Praise Yah , for it is good to sing praises to our God ; for it is pleasant and fitting to praise him . 

$ 18:147:2 Yahweh builds up Jerusalem . He gathers together the outcasts of Israel . 

$ 18:147:3 He heals the broken in heart , and binds up their wounds . 

$ 18:147:4 He counts the number of the stars . He calls them all by their names . 

$ 18:147:5 Great is our Lord , and mighty in power . His understanding is infinite . 

$ 18:147:6 Yahweh upholds the humble . He brings the wicked down to the ground . 

$ 18:147:7 Sing to Yahweh with thanksgiving . Sing praises on the harp to our God , 

$ 18:147:8 who covers the sky with clouds , who prepares rain for the earth , who makes grass grow on the mountains . 

$ 18:147:9 He provides food for the livestock , and for the young ravens when they call . 

$ 18:147:10 He doesn't delight in the strength of the horse . He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man . 

$ 18:147:11 Yahweh takes pleasure in those who fear him , in those who hope in his loving kindness . 

$ 18:147:12 Praise Yahweh , Jerusalem ! Praise your God , Zion ! 

$ 18:147:13 For he has strengthened the bars of your gates . He has blessed your children within you . 

$ 18:147:14 He makes peace in your borders . He fills you with the finest of the wheat . 

$ 18:147:15 He sends out his commandment to the earth . His word runs very swiftly . 

$ 18:147:16 He gives snow like wool , and scatters frost like ashes . 

$ 18:147:17 He hurls down his hail like pebbles . Who can stand before his cold ? 

$ 18:147:18 He sends out his word , and melts them . He causes his wind to blow , and the waters flow . 

$ 18:147:19 He shows his word to Jacob ; his statutes and his ordinances to Israel . 

$ 18:147:20 He has not done this for just any nation . They don't know his ordinances . Praise Yah ! 


$ 18:148:1 Praise Yah ! Praise Yahweh from the heavens ! Praise him in the heights ! 

$ 18:148:2 Praise him , all his angels ! Praise him , all his army ! 

$ 18:148:3 Praise him , sun and moon ! Praise him , all you shining stars ! 

$ 18:148:4 Praise him , you heavens of heavens , You waters that are above the heavens . 

$ 18:148:5 Let them praise Yahweh's name , For he commanded , and they were created . 

$ 18:148:6 He has also established them forever and ever . He has made a decree which will not pass away . 

$ 18:148:7 Praise Yahweh from the earth , you great sea creatures , and all depths ; 

$ 18:148:8 lightning and hail , snow and clouds ; stormy wind , fulfilling his word ; 

$ 18:148:9 mountains and all hills ; fruit trees and all cedars ; 

$ 18:148:10 wild animals and all livestock ; small creatures and flying birds ; 

$ 18:148:11 kings of the earth and all peoples ; princes and all judges of the earth ; 

$ 18:148:12 both young men and maidens ; old men and children : 

$ 18:148:13 let them praise Yahweh's name , for his name alone is exalted . His glory is above the earth and the heavens . 

$ 18:148:14 He has lifted up the horn of his people , the praise of all his saints ; even of the children of Israel , a people near to him . Praise Yah ! 


$ 18:149:1 Praise Yahweh ! Sing to Yahweh a new song , his praise in the assembly of the saints . 

$ 18:149:2 Let Israel rejoice in him who made them . Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King . 

$ 18:149:3 Let them praise his name in the dance ! Let them sing praises to him with tambourine and harp ! 

$ 18:149:4 For Yahweh takes pleasure in his people . He crowns the humble with salvation . 

$ 18:149:5 Let the saints rejoice in honor . Let them sing for joy on their beds . 

$ 18:149:6 May the high praises of God be in their mouths , and a two - edged sword in their hand ; 

$ 18:149:7 To execute vengeance on the nations , and punishments on the peoples ; 

$ 18:149:8 To bind their kings with chains , and their nobles with fetters of iron ; 

$ 18:149:9 to execute on them the written judgment . All his saints have this honor . Praise Yah ! 


$ 18:150:1 Praise Yah ! Praise God in his sanctuary ! Praise him in his heavens for his acts of power ! 

$ 18:150:2 Praise him for his mighty acts ! Praise him according to his excellent greatness ! 

$ 18:150:3 Praise him with the sounding of the trumpet ! Praise him with harp and lyre ! 

$ 18:150:4 Praise him with tambourine and dancing ! Praise him with stringed instruments and flute ! 

$ 18:150:5 Praise him with loud cymbals ! Praise him with resounding cymbals ! 

$ 18:150:6 Let everything that has breath praise Yah ! Praise Yah !
