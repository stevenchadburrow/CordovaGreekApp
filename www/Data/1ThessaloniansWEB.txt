$ 12:1:1 Paul , Silvanus , and Timothy , to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ : Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . 

$ 12:1:2 We always give thanks to God for all of you , mentioning you in our prayers , 

$ 12:1:3 remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and perseverance of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ , before our God and Father . 

$ 12:1:4 We know , brothers loved by God , that you are chosen , 

$ 12:1:5 and that our Good News came to you not in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy Spirit , and with much assurance . You know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake . 

$ 12:1:6 You became imitators of us , and of the Lord , having received the word in much affliction , with joy of the Holy Spirit , 

$ 12:1:7 so that you became an example to all who believe in Macedonia and in Achaia . 

$ 12:1:8 For from you the word of the Lord has been declared , not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but also in every place your faith toward God has gone out ; so that we need not to say anything . 

$ 12:1:9 For they themselves report concerning us what kind of a reception we had from you ; and how you turned to God from idols , to serve a living and true God , 

$ 12:1:10 and to wait for his Son from heaven , whom he raised from the dead - Jesus , who delivers us from the wrath to come . 


$ 12:2:1 For you yourselves know , brothers , our visit to you wasn't in vain , 

$ 12:2:2 but having suffered before and been shamefully treated , as you know , at Philippi , we grew bold in our God to tell you the Good News of God in much conflict . 

$ 12:2:3 For our exhortation is not of error , nor of uncleanness , nor in deception . 

$ 12:2:4 But even as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the Good News , so we speak ; not as pleasing men , but God , who tests our hearts . 

$ 12:2:5 For neither were we at any time found using words of flattery , as you know , nor a cloak of covetousness ( God is witness ) , 

$ 12:2:6 nor seeking glory from men ( neither from you nor from others ) , when we might have claimed authority as apostles of Christ . 

$ 12:2:7 But we were gentle among you , like a nursing mother cherishes her own children . 

$ 12:2:8 Even so , affectionately longing for you , we were well pleased to impart to you , not the Good News of God only , but also our own souls , because you had become very dear to us . 

$ 12:2:9 For you remember , brothers , our labor and travail ; for working night and day , that we might not burden any of you , we preached to you the Good News of God . 

$ 12:2:10 You are witnesses with God , how holy , righteously , and blamelessly we behaved ourselves toward you who believe . 

$ 12:2:11 As you know , we exhorted , comforted , and implored every one of you , as a father does his own children , 

$ 12:2:12 to the end that you should walk worthily of God , who calls you into his own Kingdom and glory . 

$ 12:2:13 For this cause we also thank God without ceasing , that , when you received from us the word of the message of God , you accepted it not as the word of men , but , as it is in truth , the word of God , which also works in you who believe . 

$ 12:2:14 For you , brothers , became imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus ; for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen , even as they did from the Jews 

$ 12:2:15 who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets , and drove us out , and don't please God , and are contrary to all men ; 

$ 12:2:16 forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved ; to fill up their sins always . But wrath has come on them to the uttermost . 

$ 12:2:17 But we , brothers , being bereaved of you for a short season , in presence , not in heart , tried even harder to see your face with great desire , 

$ 12:2:18 because we wanted to come to you - indeed , I , Paul , once and again - but Satan hindered us . 

$ 12:2:19 For what is our hope , or joy , or crown of rejoicing ? Isn't it even you , before our Lord Jesus at his coming ? 

$ 12:2:20 For you are our glory and our joy . 


$ 12:3:1 Therefore when we couldn't stand it any longer , we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone , 

$ 12:3:2 and sent Timothy , our brother and God's servant in the Good News of Christ , to establish you , and to comfort you concerning your faith ; 

$ 12:3:3 that no one be moved by these afflictions . For you know that we are appointed to this task . 

$ 12:3:4 For most certainly , when we were with you , we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction , even as it happened , and you know . 

$ 12:3:5 For this cause I also , when I couldn't stand it any longer , sent that I might know your faith , for fear that by any means the tempter had tempted you , and our labor would have been in vain . 

$ 12:3:6 But when Timothy came just now to us from you , and brought us glad news of your faith and love , and that you have good memories of us always , longing to see us , even as we also long to see you ; 

$ 12:3:7 for this cause , brothers , we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith . 

$ 12:3:8 For now we live , if you stand fast in the Lord . 

$ 12:3:9 For what thanksgiving can we render again to God for you , for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sakes before our God ; 

$ 12:3:10 night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face , and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith ? 

$ 12:3:11 Now may our God and Father himself , and our Lord Jesus Christ , direct our way to you ; 

$ 12:3:12 and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we also do toward you , 

$ 12:3:13 to the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father , at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints . 


$ 12:4:1 Finally then , brothers , we beg and exhort you in the Lord Jesus , that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God , that you abound more and more . 

$ 12:4:2 For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus . 

$ 12:4:3 For this is the will of God : your sanctification , that you abstain from sexual immorality , 

$ 12:4:4 that each one of you know how to control his own body in sanctification and honor , 

$ 12:4:5 not in the passion of lust , even as the Gentiles who don't know God ; 

$ 12:4:6 that no one should take advantage of and wrong a brother or sister in this matter ; because the Lord is an avenger in all these things , as also we forewarned you and testified . 

$ 12:4:7 For God called us not for uncleanness , but in sanctification . 

$ 12:4:8 Therefore he who rejects this doesn't reject man , but God , who has also given his Holy Spirit to you . 

$ 12:4:9 But concerning brotherly love , you have no need that one write to you . For you yourselves are taught by God to love one another , 

$ 12:4:10 for indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia . But we exhort you , brothers , that you abound more and more ; 

$ 12:4:11 and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , even as we instructed you ; 

$ 12:4:12 that you may walk properly toward those who are outside , and may have need of nothing . 

$ 12:4:13 But we don't want you to be ignorant , brothers , concerning those who have fallen asleep , so that you don't grieve like the rest , who have no hope . 

$ 12:4:14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again , even so God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus . 

$ 12:4:15 For this we tell you by the word of the Lord , that we who are alive , who are left until the coming of the Lord , will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep . 

$ 12:4:16 For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the archangel , and with God's trumpet . The dead in Christ will rise first , 

$ 12:4:17 then we who are alive , who are left , will be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the Lord in the air . So we will be with the Lord forever . 

$ 12:4:18 Therefore comfort one another with these words . 


$ 12:5:1 But concerning the times and the seasons , brothers , you have no need that anything be written to you . 

$ 12:5:2 For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night . 

$ 12:5:3 For when they are saying , <" Peace and safety , >" then sudden destruction will come on them , like birth pains on a pregnant woman ; and they will in no way escape . 

$ 12:5:4 But you , brothers , aren't in darkness , that the day should overtake you like a thief . 

$ 12:5:5 You are all children of light , and children of the day . We don't belong to the night , nor to darkness , 

$ 12:5:6 so then let's not sleep , as the rest do , but let's watch and be sober . 

$ 12:5:7 For those who sleep , sleep in the night ; and those who are drunk are drunk in the night . 

$ 12:5:8 But let's , since we belong to the day , be sober , putting on the breastplate of faith and love , and , for a helmet , the hope of salvation . 

$ 12:5:9 For God didn't appoint us to wrath , but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ , 

$ 12:5:10 who died for us , that , whether we wake or sleep , we should live together with him . 

$ 12:5:11 Therefore exhort one another , and build each other up , even as you also do . 

$ 12:5:12 But we beg you , brothers , to know those who labor among you , and are over you in the Lord , and admonish you , 

$ 12:5:13 and to respect and honor them in love for their work's sake . Be at peace among yourselves . 

$ 12:5:14 We exhort you , brothers , admonish the disorderly , encourage the faint - hearted , support the weak , be patient toward all . 

$ 12:5:15 See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone , but always follow after that which is good , for one another , and for all . 

$ 12:5:16 Rejoice always . 

$ 12:5:17 Pray without ceasing . 

$ 12:5:18 In everything give thanks , for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you . 

$ 12:5:19 Don't quench the Spirit . 

$ 12:5:20 Don't despise prophesies . 

$ 12:5:21 Test all things , and hold firmly that which is good . 

$ 12:5:22 Abstain from every form of evil . 

$ 12:5:23 May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely . May your whole spirit , soul , and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ . 

$ 12:5:24 He who calls you is faithful , who will also do it . 

$ 12:5:25 Brothers , pray for us . 

$ 12:5:26 Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss . 

$ 12:5:27 I solemnly command you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers . 

$ 12:5:28 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Amen .
