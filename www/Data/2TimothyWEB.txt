$ 15:1:1 Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God , according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus , 

$ 15:1:2 to Timothy , my beloved child : Grace , mercy , and peace , from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord . 

$ 15:1:3 I thank God , whom I serve as my forefathers did , with a pure conscience . How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions , night and day 

$ 15:1:4 longing to see you , remembering your tears , that I may be filled with joy ; 

$ 15:1:5 having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you ; which lived first in your grandmother Lois , and your mother Eunice , and , I am persuaded , in you also . 

$ 15:1:6 For this cause , I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands . 

$ 15:1:7 For God didn't give us a spirit of fear , but of power , love , and self - control . 

$ 15:1:8 Therefore don't be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord , nor of me his prisoner ; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God , 

$ 15:1:9 who saved us and called us with a holy calling , not according to our works , but according to his own purpose and grace , which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal , 

$ 15:1:10 but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior , Christ Jesus , who abolished death , and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News . 

$ 15:1:11 For this , I was appointed as a preacher , an apostle , and a teacher of the Gentiles . 

$ 15:1:12 For this cause I also suffer these things . Yet I am not ashamed , for I know him whom I have believed , and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day . 

$ 15:1:13 Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me , in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus . 

$ 15:1:14 That good thing which was committed to you , guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us . 

$ 15:1:15 This you know , that all who are in Asia turned away from me ; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes . 

$ 15:1:16 May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus , for he often refreshed me , and was not ashamed of my chain , 

$ 15:1:17 but when he was in Rome , he sought me diligently , and found me 

$ 15:1:18 ( the Lord grant to him to find the Lord's mercy in that day ) ; and in how many things he served at Ephesus , you know very well . 


$ 15:2:1 You therefore , my child , be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus . 

$ 15:2:2 The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses , commit the same to faithful men , who will be able to teach others also . 

$ 15:2:3 You therefore must endure hardship , as a good soldier of Christ Jesus . 

$ 15:2:4 No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life , that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier . 

$ 15:2:5 Also , if anyone competes in athletics , he isn't crowned unless he has competed by the rules . 

$ 15:2:6 The farmer who labors must be the first to get a share of the crops . 

$ 15:2:7 Consider what I say , and may the Lord give you understanding in all things . 

$ 15:2:8 Remember Jesus Christ , risen from the dead , of the offspring of David , according to my Good News , 

$ 15:2:9 in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal . But God's word isn't chained . 

$ 15:2:10 Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones' sake , that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory . 

$ 15:2:11 This saying is trustworthy : <" For if we died with him , we will also live with him . 

$ 15:2:12 If we endure , we will also reign with him . If we deny him , he also will deny us . 

$ 15:2:13 If we are faithless , he remains faithful . For he can't deny himself . >" 

$ 15:2:14 Remind them of these things , charging them in the sight of the Lord , that they don't argue about words , to no profit , to the subverting of those who hear . 

$ 15:2:15 Give diligence to present yourself approved by God , a workman who doesn't need to be ashamed , properly handling the Word of Truth . 

$ 15:2:16 But shun empty chatter , for it will go further in ungodliness , 

$ 15:2:17 and those words will consume like gangrene , of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus ; 

$ 15:2:18 men who have erred concerning the truth , saying that the resurrection is already past , and overthrowing the faith of some . 

$ 15:2:19 However God's firm foundation stands , having this seal , <" The Lord knows those who are his , >" and , <" Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness . >" 

$ 15:2:20 Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver , but also of wood and of clay . Some are for honor , and some for dishonor . 

$ 15:2:21 If anyone therefore purges himself from these , he will be a vessel for honor , sanctified , and suitable for the master's use , prepared for every good work . 

$ 15:2:22 Flee from youthful lusts ; but pursue righteousness , faith , love , and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart . 

$ 15:2:23 But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings , knowing that they generate strife . 

$ 15:2:24 The Lord's servant must not quarrel , but be gentle towards all , able to teach , patient , 

$ 15:2:25 in gentleness correcting those who oppose him : perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth , 

$ 15:2:26 and they may recover themselves out of the devil's snare , having been taken captive by him to his will . 


$ 15:3:1 But know this , that in the last days , grievous times will come . 

$ 15:3:2 For men will be lovers of self , lovers of money , boastful , arrogant , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , unthankful , unholy , 

$ 15:3:3 without natural affection , unforgiving , slanderers , without self - control , fierce , not lovers of good , 

$ 15:3:4 traitors , headstrong , conceited , lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God ; 

$ 15:3:5 holding a form of godliness , but having denied its power . Turn away from these , also . 

$ 15:3:6 For some of these are people who creep into houses , and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins , led away by various lusts , 

$ 15:3:7 always learning , and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth . 

$ 15:3:8 Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses , so do these also oppose the truth ; men corrupted in mind , who concerning the faith are rejected . 

$ 15:3:9 But they will proceed no further . For their folly will be evident to all men , as theirs also came to be . 

$ 15:3:10 But you did follow my teaching , conduct , purpose , faith , patience , love , steadfastness , 

$ 15:3:11 persecutions , and sufferings : those things that happened to me at Antioch , Iconium , and Lystra . I endured those persecutions . The Lord delivered me out of them all . 

$ 15:3:12 Yes , and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution . 

$ 15:3:13 But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse , deceiving and being deceived . 

$ 15:3:14 But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of , knowing from whom you have learned them . 

$ 15:3:15 From infancy , you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith , which is in Christ Jesus . 

$ 15:3:16 Every Scripture is God - breathed and profitable for teaching , for reproof , for correction , and for instruction in righteousness , 

$ 15:3:17 that each person who belongs to God may be complete , thoroughly equipped for every good work . 


$ 15:4:1 I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ , who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom : 

$ 15:4:2 preach the word ; be urgent in season and out of season ; reprove , rebuke , and exhort , with all patience and teaching . 

$ 15:4:3 For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine , but , having itching ears , will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts ; 

$ 15:4:4 and will turn away their ears from the truth , and turn away to fables . 

$ 15:4:5 But you be sober in all things , suffer hardship , do the work of an evangelist , and fulfill your ministry . 

$ 15:4:6 For I am already being offered , and the time of my departure has come . 

$ 15:4:7 I have fought the good fight . I have finished the course . I have kept the faith . 

$ 15:4:8 From now on , there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous judge , will give to me on that day ; and not to me only , but also to all those who have loved his appearing . 

$ 15:4:9 Be diligent to come to me soon , 

$ 15:4:10 for Demas left me , having loved this present world , and went to Thessalonica ; Crescens to Galatia , and Titus to Dalmatia . 

$ 15:4:11 Only Luke is with me . Take Mark , and bring him with you , for he is useful to me for service . 

$ 15:4:12 But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus . 

$ 15:4:13 Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come , and the books , especially the parchments . 

$ 15:4:14 Alexander , the coppersmith , did much evil to me . The Lord will repay him according to his deeds , 

$ 15:4:15 of whom you also must beware ; for he greatly opposed our words . 

$ 15:4:16 At my first defense , no one came to help me , but all left me . May it not be held against them . 

$ 15:4:17 But the Lord stood by me , and strengthened me , that through me the message might be fully proclaimed , and that all the Gentiles might hear ; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion . 

$ 15:4:18 And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work , and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom ; to whom be the glory forever and ever . Amen . 

$ 15:4:19 Greet Prisca and Aquila , and the house of Onesiphorus . 

$ 15:4:20 Erastus remained at Corinth , but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick . 

$ 15:4:21 Be diligent to come before winter . Eubulus salutes you , as do Pudens , Linus , Claudia , and all the brothers . 

$ 15:4:22 The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Grace be with you . Amen .
