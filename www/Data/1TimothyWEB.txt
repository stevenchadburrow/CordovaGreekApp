$ 14:1:1 Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the commandment of God our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ our hope ; 

$ 14:1:2 to Timothy , my true child in faith : Grace , mercy , and peace , from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord . 

$ 14:1:3 As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia , stay at Ephesus that you might command certain men not to teach a different doctrine , 

$ 14:1:4 and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies , which cause disputes , rather than God's stewardship , which is in faith - 

$ 14:1:5 but the goal of this command is love , out of a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith ; 

$ 14:1:6 from which things some , having missed the mark , have turned away to vain talking ; 

$ 14:1:7 desiring to be teachers of the law , though they understand neither what they say , nor about what they strongly affirm . 

$ 14:1:8 But we know that the law is good , if a person uses it lawfully , 

$ 14:1:9 as knowing this , that law is not made for a righteous person , but for the lawless and insubordinate , for the ungodly and sinners , for the unholy and profane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for manslayers , 

$ 14:1:10 for the sexually immoral , for homosexuals , for slave - traders , for liars , for perjurers , and for any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine ; 

$ 14:1:11 according to the Good News of the glory of the blessed God , which was committed to my trust . 

$ 14:1:12 I thank him who enabled me , Christ Jesus our Lord , because he counted me faithful , appointing me to service ; 

$ 14:1:13 although I used to be a blasphemer , a persecutor , and insolent . However , I obtained mercy , because I did it ignorantly in unbelief . 

$ 14:1:14 The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus . 

$ 14:1:15 The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners ; of whom I am chief . 

$ 14:1:16 However , for this cause I obtained mercy , that in me first , Jesus Christ might display all his patience , for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life . 

$ 14:1:17 Now to the King eternal , immortal , invisible , to God who alone is wise , be honor and glory forever and ever . Amen . 

$ 14:1:18 This instruction I commit to you , my child Timothy , according to the prophecies which were given to you before , that by them you may wage the good warfare ; 

$ 14:1:19 holding faith and a good conscience ; which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith ; 

$ 14:1:20 of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander ; whom I delivered to Satan , that they might be taught not to blaspheme . 


$ 14:2:1 I exhort therefore , first of all , that petitions , prayers , intercessions , and givings of thanks , be made for all men : 

$ 14:2:2 for kings and all who are in high places ; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence . 

$ 14:2:3 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior ; 

$ 14:2:4 who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth . 

$ 14:2:5 For there is one God , and one mediator between God and men , the man Christ Jesus , 

$ 14:2:6 who gave himself as a ransom for all ; the testimony in its own times ; 

$ 14:2:7 to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle ( I am telling the truth in Christ , not lying ) , a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth . 

$ 14:2:8 I desire therefore that the men in every place pray , lifting up holy hands without anger and doubting . 

$ 14:2:9 In the same way , that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing , with modesty and propriety ; not just with braided hair , gold , pearls , or expensive clothing ; 

$ 14:2:10 but ( which becomes women professing godliness ) with good works . 

$ 14:2:11 Let a woman learn in quietness with full submission . 

$ 14:2:12 But I don't permit a woman to teach , nor to exercise authority over a man , but to be in quietness . 

$ 14:2:13 For Adam was first formed , then Eve . 

$ 14:2:14 Adam wasn't deceived , but the woman , being deceived , has fallen into disobedience ; 

$ 14:2:15 but she will be saved through her childbearing , if they continue in faith , love , and sanctification with sobriety . 


$ 14:3:1 This is a faithful saying : someone who seeks to be an overseer desires a good work . 

$ 14:3:2 The overseer therefore must be without reproach , the husband of one wife , temperate , sensible , modest , hospitable , good at teaching ; 

$ 14:3:3 not a drinker , not violent , not greedy for money , but gentle , not quarrelsome , not covetous ; 

$ 14:3:4 one who rules his own house well , having children in subjection with all reverence ; 

$ 14:3:5 ( but how could someone who doesn't know how to rule one's own house take care of God's assembly ? ) 

$ 14:3:6 not a new convert , lest being puffed up he fall into the same condemnation as the devil . 

$ 14:3:7 Moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside , to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of the devil . 

$ 14:3:8 Servants , in the same way , must be reverent , not double - tongued , not addicted to much wine , not greedy for money ; 

$ 14:3:9 holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience . 

$ 14:3:10 Let them also first be tested ; then let them serve if they are blameless . 

$ 14:3:11 Their wives in the same way must be reverent , not slanderers , temperate , faithful in all things . 

$ 14:3:12 Let servants be husbands of one wife , ruling their children and their own houses well . 

$ 14:3:13 For those who have served well gain for themselves a good standing , and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus . 

$ 14:3:14 These things I write to you , hoping to come to you shortly ; 

$ 14:3:15 but if I wait long , that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in God's house , which is the assembly of the living God , the pillar and ground of the truth . 

$ 14:3:16 Without controversy , the mystery of godliness is great : God was revealed in the flesh , justified in the spirit , seen by angels , preached among the nations , believed on in the world , and received up in glory . 


$ 14:4:1 But the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall away from the faith , paying attention to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons , 

$ 14:4:2 through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies , branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron ; 

$ 14:4:3 forbidding marriage and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth . 

$ 14:4:4 For every creature of God is good , and nothing is to be rejected , if it is received with thanksgiving . 

$ 14:4:5 For it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer . 

$ 14:4:6 If you instruct the brothers of these things , you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus , nourished in the words of the faith , and of the good doctrine which you have followed . 

$ 14:4:7 But refuse profane and old wives' fables . Exercise yourself toward godliness . 

$ 14:4:8 For bodily exercise has some value , but godliness has value in all things , having the promise of the life which is now , and of that which is to come . 

$ 14:4:9 This saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance . 

$ 14:4:10 For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach , because we have set our trust in the living God , who is the Savior of all men , especially of those who believe . 

$ 14:4:11 Command and teach these things . 

$ 14:4:12 Let no man despise your youth ; but be an example to those who believe , in word , in your way of life , in love , in spirit , in faith , and in purity . 

$ 14:4:13 Until I come , pay attention to reading , to exhortation , and to teaching . 

$ 14:4:14 Don't neglect the gift that is in you , which was given to you by prophecy , with the laying on of the hands of the elders . 

$ 14:4:15 Be diligent in these things . Give yourself wholly to them , that your progress may be revealed to all . 

$ 14:4:16 Pay attention to yourself , and to your teaching . Continue in these things , for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you . 


$ 14:5:1 Don't rebuke an older man , but exhort him as a father ; the younger men as brothers ; 

$ 14:5:2 the elder women as mothers ; the younger as sisters , in all purity . 

$ 14:5:3 Honor widows who are widows indeed . 

$ 14:5:4 But if any widow has children or grandchildren , let them learn first to show piety towards their own family , and to repay their parents , for this is acceptable in the sight of God . 

$ 14:5:5 Now she who is a widow indeed , and desolate , has her hope set on God , and continues in petitions and prayers night and day . 

$ 14:5:6 But she who gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives . 

$ 14:5:7 Also command these things , that they may be without reproach . 

$ 14:5:8 But if anyone doesn't provide for his own , and especially his own household , he has denied the faith , and is worse than an unbeliever . 

$ 14:5:9 Let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old , having been the wife of one man , 

$ 14:5:10 being approved by good works , if she has brought up children , if she has been hospitable to strangers , if she has washed the saints' feet , if she has relieved the afflicted , and if she has diligently followed every good work . 

$ 14:5:11 But refuse younger widows , for when they have grown wanton against Christ , they desire to marry ; 

$ 14:5:12 having condemnation , because they have rejected their first pledge . 

$ 14:5:13 Besides , they also learn to be idle , going about from house to house . Not only idle , but also gossips and busybodies , saying things which they ought not . 

$ 14:5:14 I desire therefore that the younger widows marry , bear children , rule the household , and give no occasion to the adversary for insulting . 

$ 14:5:15 For already some have turned away after Satan . 

$ 14:5:16 If any man or woman who believes has widows , let them relieve them , and don't let the assembly be burdened ; that it might relieve those who are widows indeed . 

$ 14:5:17 Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor , especially those who labor in the word and in teaching . 

$ 14:5:18 For the Scripture says , <" You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain . >" And , \ <" The laborer is worthy of his wages . >" /  

$ 14:5:19 Don't receive an accusation against an elder , except at the word of two or three witnesses . 

$ 14:5:20 Those who sin , reprove in the sight of all , that the rest also may be in fear . 

$ 14:5:21 I command you in the sight of God , and the Lord Jesus Christ , and the chosen angels , that you observe these things without prejudice , doing nothing by partiality . 

$ 14:5:22 Lay hands hastily on no one , neither be a participant in other people's sins . Keep yourself pure . 

$ 14:5:23 Be no longer a drinker of water only , but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your frequent infirmities . 

$ 14:5:24 Some men's sins are evident , preceding them to judgment , and some also follow later . 

$ 14:5:25 In the same way also there are good works that are obvious , and those that are otherwise can't be hidden . 


$ 14:6:1 Let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor , that the name of God and the doctrine not be blasphemed . 

$ 14:6:2 Those who have believing masters , let them not despise them , because they are brothers , but rather let them serve them , because those who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved . Teach and exhort these things . 

$ 14:6:3 If anyone teaches a different doctrine , and doesn't consent to sound words , the words of our Lord Jesus Christ , and to the doctrine which is according to godliness , 

$ 14:6:4 he is conceited , knowing nothing , but obsessed with arguments , disputes , and word battles , from which come envy , strife , insulting , evil suspicions , 

$ 14:6:5 constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth , who suppose that godliness is a means of gain . Withdraw yourself from such . 

$ 14:6:6 But godliness with contentment is great gain . 

$ 14:6:7 For we brought nothing into the world , and we certainly can't carry anything out . 

$ 14:6:8 But having food and clothing , we will be content with that . 

$ 14:6:9 But those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful lusts , such as drown men in ruin and destruction . 

$ 14:6:10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil . Some have been led astray from the faith in their greed , and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows . 

$ 14:6:11 But you , man of God , flee these things , and follow after righteousness , godliness , faith , love , perseverance , and gentleness . 

$ 14:6:12 Fight the good fight of faith . Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called , and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses . 

$ 14:6:13 I command you before God , who gives life to all things , and before Christ Jesus , who before Pontius Pilate testified the good confession , 

$ 14:6:14 that you keep the commandment without spot , blameless , until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ ; 

$ 14:6:15 which in its own times he will show , who is the blessed and only Ruler , the King of kings , and Lord of lords ; 

$ 14:6:16 who alone has immortality , dwelling in unapproachable light ; whom no man has seen , nor can see : to whom be honor and eternal power . Amen . 

$ 14:6:17 Charge those who are rich in this present world that they not be arrogant , nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches , but on the living God , who richly provides us with everything to enjoy ; 

$ 14:6:18 that they do good , that they be rich in good works , that they be ready to distribute , willing to share ; 

$ 14:6:19 laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come , that they may lay hold of eternal life . 

$ 14:6:20 Timothy , guard that which is committed to you , turning away from the empty chatter and oppositions of what is falsely called knowledge ; 

$ 14:6:21 which some profess , and thus have wandered from the faith . Grace be with you . Amen .
