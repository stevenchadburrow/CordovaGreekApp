$ 17:1:1 There was a man in the land of Uz , whose name was Job . That man was blameless and upright , and one who feared God , and turned away from evil . 

$ 17:1:2 There were born to him seven sons and three daughters . 

$ 17:1:3 His possessions also were seven thousand sheep , three thousand camels , five hundred yoke of oxen , five hundred female donkeys , and a very great household ; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east . 

$ 17:1:4 His sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday ; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them . 

$ 17:1:5 It was so , when the days of their feasting had run their course , that Job sent and sanctified them , and rose up early in the morning , and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all . For Job said , <" It may be that my sons have sinned , and renounced God in their hearts . >" Job did so continually . 

$ 17:1:6 Now on the day when God's sons came to present themselves before Yahweh , Satan also came among them . 

$ 17:1:7 Yahweh said to Satan , <" Where have you come from ? >" Then Satan answered Yahweh , and said , <" From going back and forth in the earth , and from walking up and down in it . >" 

$ 17:1:8 Yahweh said to Satan , <" Have you considered my servant , Job ? For there is no one like him in the earth , a blameless and an upright man , one who fears God , and turns away from evil . >" 

$ 17:1:9 Then Satan answered Yahweh , and said , <" Does Job fear God for nothing ? 

$ 17:1:10 Haven't you made a hedge around him , and around his house , and around all that he has , on every side ? You have blessed the work of his hands , and his substance is increased in the land . 

$ 17:1:11 But stretch out your hand now , and touch all that he has , and he will renounce you to your face . >" 

$ 17:1:12 Yahweh said to Satan , <" Behold , all that he has is in your power . Only on himself don't stretch out your hand . >" So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh . 

$ 17:1:13 It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house , 

$ 17:1:14 that there came a messenger to Job , and said , <" The oxen were plowing , and the donkeys feeding beside them , 

$ 17:1:15 and the Sabeans attacked , and took them away . Yes , they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword , and I alone have escaped to tell you . >" 

$ 17:1:16 While he was still speaking , there also came another , and said , <" The fire of God has fallen from the sky , and has burned up the sheep and the servants , and consumed them , and I alone have escaped to tell you . >" 

$ 17:1:17 While he was still speaking , there came also another , and said , <" The Chaldeans made three bands , and swept down on the camels , and have taken them away , yes , and killed the servants with the edge of the sword ; and I alone have escaped to tell you . >" 

$ 17:1:18 While he was still speaking , there came also another , and said , <" Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house , 

$ 17:1:19 and behold , there came a great wind from the wilderness , and struck the four corners of the house , and it fell on the young men , and they are dead . I alone have escaped to tell you . >" 

$ 17:1:20 Then Job arose , and tore his robe , and shaved his head , and fell down on the ground , and worshiped . 

$ 17:1:21 He said , <" Naked I came out of my mother's womb , and naked shall I return there . Yahweh gave , and Yahweh has taken away . Blessed be Yahweh's name . >" 

$ 17:1:22 In all this , Job didn't sin , nor charge God with wrongdoing . 


$ 17:2:1 Again , on the day when the God's sons came to present themselves before Yahweh , Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh . 

$ 17:2:2 Yahweh said to Satan , <" Where have you come from ? >" Satan answered Yahweh , and said , <" From going back and forth in the earth , and from walking up and down in it . >" 

$ 17:2:3 Yahweh said to Satan , <" Have you considered my servant Job ? For there is no one like him in the earth , a blameless and an upright man , one who fears God , and turns away from evil . He still maintains his integrity , although you incited me against him , to ruin him without cause . >" 

$ 17:2:4 Satan answered Yahweh , and said , <" Skin for skin . Yes , all that a man has he will give for his life . 

$ 17:2:5 But stretch out your hand now , and touch his bone and his flesh , and he will renounce you to your face . >" 

$ 17:2:6 Yahweh said to Satan , <" Behold , he is in your hand . Only spare his life . >" 

$ 17:2:7 So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh , and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head . 

$ 17:2:8 He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with , and he sat among the ashes . 

$ 17:2:9 Then his wife said to him , <" Do you still maintain your integrity ? Renounce God , and die . >" 

$ 17:2:10 But he said to her , <" You speak as one of the foolish women would speak . What ? Shall we receive good at the hand of God , and shall we not receive evil ? >" In all this Job didn't sin with his lips . 

$ 17:2:11 Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him , they each came from his own place : Eliphaz the Temanite , Bildad the Shuhite , and Zophar the Naamathite ; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him . 

$ 17:2:12 When they lifted up their eyes from a distance , and didn't recognize him , they raised their voices , and wept ; and they each tore his robe , and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky . 

$ 17:2:13 So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights , and no one spoke a word to him , for they saw that his grief was very great . 


$ 17:3:1 After this Job opened his mouth , and cursed the day of his birth . 

$ 17:3:2 Job answered : 

$ 17:3:3 <" Let the day perish in which I was born , the night which said , <' There is a boy conceived . >' 

$ 17:3:4 Let that day be darkness . Don't let God from above seek for it , neither let the light shine on it . 

$ 17:3:5 Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own . Let a cloud dwell on it . Let all that makes black the day terrify it . 

$ 17:3:6 As for that night , let thick darkness seize on it . Let it not rejoice among the days of the year . Let it not come into the number of the months . 

$ 17:3:7 Behold , let that night be barren . Let no joyful voice come therein . 

$ 17:3:8 Let them curse it who curse the day , who are ready to rouse up leviathan . 

$ 17:3:9 Let the stars of its twilight be dark . Let it look for light , but have none , neither let it see the eyelids of the morning , 

$ 17:3:10 because it didn't shut up the doors of my mother's womb , nor did it hide trouble from my eyes . 

$ 17:3:11 <" Why didn't I die from the womb ? Why didn't I give up the spirit when my mother bore me ? 

$ 17:3:12 Why did the knees receive me ? Or why the breast , that I should nurse ? 

$ 17:3:13 For now should I have lain down and been quiet . I should have slept , then I would have been at rest , 

$ 17:3:14 with kings and counselors of the earth , who built up waste places for themselves ; 

$ 17:3:15 or with princes who had gold , who filled their houses with silver : 

$ 17:3:16 or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been , as infants who never saw light . 

$ 17:3:17 There the wicked cease from troubling . There the weary are at rest . 

$ 17:3:18 There the prisoners are at ease together . They don't hear the voice of the taskmaster . 

$ 17:3:19 The small and the great are there . The servant is free from his master . 

$ 17:3:20 <" Why is light given to him who is in misery , life to the bitter in soul , 

$ 17:3:21 Who long for death , but it doesn't come ; and dig for it more than for hidden treasures , 

$ 17:3:22 who rejoice exceedingly , and are glad , when they can find the grave ? 

$ 17:3:23 Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden , whom God has hedged in ? 

$ 17:3:24 For my sighing comes before I eat . My groanings are poured out like water . 

$ 17:3:25 For the thing which I fear comes on me , That which I am afraid of comes to me . 

$ 17:3:26 I am not at ease , neither am I quiet , neither have I rest ; but trouble comes . >" 


$ 17:4:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered , 

$ 17:4:2 <" If someone ventures to talk with you , will you be grieved ? But who can withhold himself from speaking ? 

$ 17:4:3 Behold , you have instructed many , you have strengthened the weak hands . 

$ 17:4:4 Your words have supported him who was falling , You have made firm the feeble knees . 

$ 17:4:5 But now it has come to you , and you faint . It touches you , and you are troubled . 

$ 17:4:6 Isn't your piety your confidence ? Isn't the integrity of your ways your hope ? 

$ 17:4:7 <" Remember , now , whoever perished , being innocent ? Or where were the upright cut off ? 

$ 17:4:8 According to what I have seen , those who plow iniquity , and sow trouble , reap the same . 

$ 17:4:9 By the breath of God they perish . By the blast of his anger are they consumed . 

$ 17:4:10 The roaring of the lion , and the voice of the fierce lion , the teeth of the young lions , are broken . 

$ 17:4:11 The old lion perishes for lack of prey . The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad . 

$ 17:4:12 <" Now a thing was secretly brought to me . My ear received a whisper of it . 

$ 17:4:13 In thoughts from the visions of the night , when deep sleep falls on men , 

$ 17:4:14 fear came on me , and trembling , which made all my bones shake . 

$ 17:4:15 Then a spirit passed before my face . The hair of my flesh stood up . 

$ 17:4:16 It stood still , but I couldn't discern its appearance . A form was before my eyes . Silence , then I heard a voice , saying , 

$ 17:4:17 <' Shall mortal man be more just than God ? Shall a man be more pure than his Maker ? 

$ 17:4:18 Behold , he puts no trust in his servants . He charges his angels with error . 

$ 17:4:19 How much more , those who dwell in houses of clay , whose foundation is in the dust , who are crushed before the moth ! 

$ 17:4:20 Between morning and evening they are destroyed . They perish forever without any regarding it . 

$ 17:4:21 Isn't their tent cord plucked up within them ? They die , and that without wisdom . >' 


$ 17:5:1 <" Call now ; is there any who will answer you ? To which of the holy ones will you turn ? 

$ 17:5:2 For resentment kills the foolish man , and jealousy kills the simple . 

$ 17:5:3 I have seen the foolish taking root , but suddenly I cursed his habitation . 

$ 17:5:4 His children are far from safety . They are crushed in the gate . Neither is there any to deliver them , 

$ 17:5:5 whose harvest the hungry eats up , and take it even out of the thorns . The snare gapes for their substance . 

$ 17:5:6 For affliction doesn't come out of the dust , neither does trouble spring out of the ground ; 

$ 17:5:7 but man is born to trouble , as the sparks fly upward . 

$ 17:5:8 <" But as for me , I would seek God . I would commit my cause to God , 

$ 17:5:9 who does great things that can't be fathomed , marvelous things without number ; 

$ 17:5:10 who gives rain on the earth , and sends waters on the fields ; 

$ 17:5:11 so that he sets up on high those who are low , those who mourn are exalted to safety . 

$ 17:5:12 He frustrates the plans of the crafty , So that their hands can't perform their enterprise . 

$ 17:5:13 He takes the wise in their own craftiness ; the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong . 

$ 17:5:14 They meet with darkness in the day time , and grope at noonday as in the night . 

$ 17:5:15 But he saves from the sword of their mouth , even the needy from the hand of the mighty . 

$ 17:5:16 So the poor has hope , and injustice shuts her mouth . 

$ 17:5:17 <" Behold , happy is the man whom God corrects . Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty . 

$ 17:5:18 For he wounds , and binds up . He injures , and his hands make whole . 

$ 17:5:19 He will deliver you in six troubles ; yes , in seven no evil shall touch you . 

$ 17:5:20 In famine he will redeem you from death ; in war , from the power of the sword . 

$ 17:5:21 You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue , neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes . 

$ 17:5:22 At destruction and famine you shall laugh , neither shall you be afraid of the animals of the earth . 

$ 17:5:23 For you shall be allied with the stones of the field . The animals of the field shall be at peace with you . 

$ 17:5:24 You shall know that your tent is in peace . You shall visit your fold , and shall miss nothing . 

$ 17:5:25 You shall know also that your offspring shall be great , Your offspring as the grass of the earth . 

$ 17:5:26 You shall come to your grave in a full age , like a shock of grain comes in its season . 

$ 17:5:27 Look this , we have searched it , so it is . Hear it , and know it for your good . >" 


$ 17:6:1 Then Job answered , 

$ 17:6:2 <" Oh that my anguish were weighed , and all my calamity laid in the balances ! 

$ 17:6:3 For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas , therefore have my words been rash . 

$ 17:6:4 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me . My spirit drinks up their poison . The terrors of God set themselves in array against me . 

$ 17:6:5 Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass ? Or does the ox low over his fodder ? 

$ 17:6:6 Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt ? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg ? 

$ 17:6:7 My soul refuses to touch them . They are as loathsome food to me . 

$ 17:6:8 <" Oh that I might have my request , that God would grant the thing that I long for , 

$ 17:6:9 even that it would please God to crush me ; that he would let loose his hand , and cut me off ! 

$ 17:6:10 Be it still my consolation , yes , let me exult in pain that doesn't spare , that I have not denied the words of the Holy One . 

$ 17:6:11 What is my strength , that I should wait ? What is my end , that I should be patient ? 

$ 17:6:12 Is my strength the strength of stones ? Or is my flesh of bronze ? 

$ 17:6:13 Isn't it that I have no help in me , That wisdom is driven quite from me ? 

$ 17:6:14 <" To him who is ready to faint , kindness should be shown from his friend ; even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty . 

$ 17:6:15 My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook , as the channel of brooks that pass away ; 

$ 17:6:16 Which are black by reason of the ice , in which the snow hides itself . 

$ 17:6:17 In the dry season , they vanish . When it is hot , they are consumed out of their place . 

$ 17:6:18 The caravans that travel beside them turn away . They go up into the waste , and perish . 

$ 17:6:19 The caravans of Tema looked . The companies of Sheba waited for them . 

$ 17:6:20 They were distressed because they were confident . They came there , and were confounded . 

$ 17:6:21 For now you are nothing . You see a terror , and are afraid . 

$ 17:6:22 Did I say , <' Give to me ? >' or , <' Offer a present for me from your substance ? >' 

$ 17:6:23 or , <' Deliver me from the adversary's hand ? >' or , <' Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors ? >' 

$ 17:6:24 <" Teach me , and I will hold my peace . Cause me to understand wherein I have erred . 

$ 17:6:25 How forcible are words of uprightness ! But your reproof , what does it reprove ? 

$ 17:6:26 Do you intend to reprove words , since the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind ? 

$ 17:6:27 Yes , you would even cast lots for the fatherless , and make merchandise of your friend . 

$ 17:6:28 Now therefore be pleased to look at me , for surely I shall not lie to your face . 

$ 17:6:29 Please return . Let there be no injustice . Yes , return again . My cause is righteous . 

$ 17:6:30 Is there injustice on my tongue ? Can't my taste discern mischievous things ? 


$ 17:7:1 <" Isn't a man forced to labor on earth ? Aren't his days like the days of a hired hand ? 

$ 17:7:2 As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow , as a hireling who looks for his wages , 

$ 17:7:3 so am I made to possess months of misery , wearisome nights are appointed to me . 

$ 17:7:4 When I lie down , I say , <' When shall I arise , and the night be gone ? >' I toss and turn until the dawning of the day . 

$ 17:7:5 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust . My skin closes up , and breaks out afresh . 

$ 17:7:6 My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle , and are spent without hope . 

$ 17:7:7 Oh remember that my life is a breath . My eye shall no more see good . 

$ 17:7:8 The eye of him who sees me shall see me no more . Your eyes shall be on me , but I shall not be . 

$ 17:7:9 As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away , so he who goes down to Sheol shall come up no more . 

$ 17:7:10 He shall return no more to his house , neither shall his place know him any more . 

$ 17:7:11 <" Therefore I will not keep silent . I will speak in the anguish of my spirit . I will complain in the bitterness of my soul . 

$ 17:7:12 Am I a sea , or a sea monster , that you put a guard over me ? 

$ 17:7:13 When I say , <' My bed shall comfort me . My couch shall ease my complaint ; >' 

$ 17:7:14 then you scare me with dreams , and terrify me through visions : 

$ 17:7:15 so that my soul chooses strangling , death rather than my bones . 

$ 17:7:16 I loathe my life . I don't want to live forever . Leave me alone , for my days are but a breath . 

$ 17:7:17 What is man , that you should magnify him , that you should set your mind on him , 

$ 17:7:18 that you should visit him every morning , and test him every moment ? 

$ 17:7:19 How long will you not look away from me , nor leave me alone until I swallow down my spittle ? 

$ 17:7:20 If I have sinned , what do I do to you , you watcher of men ? Why have you set me as a mark for you , so that I am a burden to myself ? 

$ 17:7:21 Why do you not pardon my disobedience , and take away my iniquity ? For now shall I lie down in the dust . You will seek me diligently , but I shall not be . >" 


$ 17:8:1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered , 

$ 17:8:2 <" How long will you speak these things ? Shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind ? 

$ 17:8:3 Does God pervert justice ? Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness ? 

$ 17:8:4 If your children have sinned against him , He has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience . 

$ 17:8:5 If you want to seek God diligently , make your supplication to the Almighty . 

$ 17:8:6 If you were pure and upright , surely now he would awaken for you , and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous . 

$ 17:8:7 Though your beginning was small , yet your latter end would greatly increase . 

$ 17:8:8 <" Please inquire of past generations . Find out about the learning of their fathers . 

$ 17:8:9 ( For we are but of yesterday , and know nothing , because our days on earth are a shadow . ) 

$ 17:8:10 Shall they not teach you , tell you , and utter words out of their heart ? 

$ 17:8:11 <" Can the papyrus grow up without mire ? Can the rushes grow without water ? 

$ 17:8:12 While it is yet in its greenness , not cut down , it withers before any other reed . 

$ 17:8:13 So are the paths of all who forget God . The hope of the godless man shall perish , 

$ 17:8:14 Whose confidence shall break apart , Whose trust is a spider's web . 

$ 17:8:15 He shall lean on his house , but it shall not stand . He shall cling to it , but it shall not endure . 

$ 17:8:16 He is green before the sun . His shoots go out along his garden . 

$ 17:8:17 His roots are wrapped around the rock pile . He sees the place of stones . 

$ 17:8:18 If he is destroyed from his place , then it shall deny him , saying , <' I have not seen you . >' 

$ 17:8:19 Behold , this is the joy of his way : out of the earth , others shall spring . 

$ 17:8:20 <" Behold , God will not cast away a blameless man , neither will he uphold the evildoers . 

$ 17:8:21 He will still fill your mouth with laughter , your lips with shouting . 

$ 17:8:22 Those who hate you shall be clothed with shame . The tent of the wicked shall be no more . >" 


$ 17:9:1 Then Job answered , 

$ 17:9:2 <" Truly I know that it is so , but how can man be just with God ? 

$ 17:9:3 If he is pleased to contend with him , he can't answer him one time in a thousand . 

$ 17:9:4 God who is wise in heart , and mighty in strength : who has hardened himself against him , and prospered ? 

$ 17:9:5 He removes the mountains , and they don't know it , when he overturns them in his anger . 

$ 17:9:6 He shakes the earth out of its place . Its pillars tremble . 

$ 17:9:7 He commands the sun , and it doesn't rise , and seals up the stars . 

$ 17:9:8 He alone stretches out the heavens , and treads on the waves of the sea . 

$ 17:9:9 He makes the Bear , Orion , and the Pleiades , and the rooms of the south . 

$ 17:9:10 He does great things past finding out ; yes , marvelous things without number . 

$ 17:9:11 Behold , he goes by me , and I don't see him . He passes on also , but I don't perceive him . 

$ 17:9:12 Behold , he snatches away . Who can hinder him ? Who will ask him , <' What are you doing ? >' 

$ 17:9:13 <" God will not withdraw his anger . The helpers of Rahab stoop under him . 

$ 17:9:14 How much less shall I answer him , And choose my words to argue with him ? 

$ 17:9:15 Though I were righteous , yet I wouldn't answer him . I would make supplication to my judge . 

$ 17:9:16 If I had called , and he had answered me , yet I wouldn't believe that he listened to my voice . 

$ 17:9:17 For he breaks me with a storm , and multiplies my wounds without cause . 

$ 17:9:18 He will not allow me to catch my breath , but fills me with bitterness . 

$ 17:9:19 If it is a matter of strength , behold , he is mighty ! If of justice , <' Who , >' says he , <' will summon me ? >' 

$ 17:9:20 Though I am righteous , my own mouth shall condemn me . Though I am blameless , it shall prove me perverse . 

$ 17:9:21 I am blameless . I don't respect myself . I despise my life . 

$ 17:9:22 <" It is all the same . Therefore I say he destroys the blameless and the wicked . 

$ 17:9:23 If the scourge kills suddenly , he will mock at the trial of the innocent . 

$ 17:9:24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked . He covers the faces of its judges . If not he , then who is it ? 

$ 17:9:25 <" Now my days are swifter than a runner . They flee away , they see no good . 

$ 17:9:26 They have passed away as the swift ships , as the eagle that swoops on the prey . 

$ 17:9:27 If I say , <' I will forget my complaint , I will put off my sad face , and cheer up ; >' 

$ 17:9:28 I am afraid of all my sorrows , I know that you will not hold me innocent . 

$ 17:9:29 I shall be condemned . Why then do I labor in vain ? 

$ 17:9:30 If I wash myself with snow , and cleanse my hands with lye , 

$ 17:9:31 yet you will plunge me in the ditch . My own clothes shall abhor me . 

$ 17:9:32 For he is not a man , as I am , that I should answer him , that we should come together in judgment . 

$ 17:9:33 There is no umpire between us , that might lay his hand on us both . 

$ 17:9:34 Let him take his rod away from me . Let his terror not make me afraid ; 

$ 17:9:35 then I would speak , and not fear him , for I am not so in myself . 


$ 17:10:1 <" My soul is weary of my life . I will give free course to my complaint . I will speak in the bitterness of my soul . 

$ 17:10:2 I will tell God , <' Do not condemn me . Show me why you contend with me . 

$ 17:10:3 Is it good to you that you should oppress , that you should despise the work of your hands , and smile on the counsel of the wicked ? 

$ 17:10:4 Do you have eyes of flesh ? Or do you see as man sees ? 

$ 17:10:5 Are your days as the days of mortals , or your years as man's years , 

$ 17:10:6 that you inquire after my iniquity , and search after my sin ? 

$ 17:10:7 Although you know that I am not wicked , there is no one who can deliver out of your hand . 

$ 17:10:8 <" <' Your hands have framed me and fashioned me altogether , yet you destroy me . 

$ 17:10:9 Remember , I beg you , that you have fashioned me as clay . Will you bring me into dust again ? 

$ 17:10:10 Haven't you poured me out like milk , and curdled me like cheese ? 

$ 17:10:11 You have clothed me with skin and flesh , and knit me together with bones and sinews . 

$ 17:10:12 You have granted me life and loving kindness . Your visitation has preserved my spirit . 

$ 17:10:13 Yet you hid these things in your heart . I know that this is with you : 

$ 17:10:14 if I sin , then you mark me . You will not acquit me from my iniquity . 

$ 17:10:15 If I am wicked , woe to me . If I am righteous , I still shall not lift up my head , being filled with disgrace , and conscious of my affliction . 

$ 17:10:16 If my head is held high , you hunt me like a lion . Again you show yourself powerful to me . 

$ 17:10:17 You renew your witnesses against me , and increase your indignation on me . Changes and warfare are with me . 

$ 17:10:18 <" <' Why , then , have you brought me out of the womb ? I wish I had given up the spirit , and no eye had seen me . 

$ 17:10:19 I should have been as though I had not been . I should have been carried from the womb to the grave . 

$ 17:10:20 Aren't my days few ? Cease then . Leave me alone , that I may find a little comfort , 

$ 17:10:21 before I go where I shall not return from , to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death ; 

$ 17:10:22 the land dark as midnight , of the shadow of death , without any order , where the light is as midnight . >' >" 


$ 17:11:1 Then Zophar , the Naamathite , answered , 

$ 17:11:2 <" Shouldn't the multitude of words be answered ? Should a man full of talk be justified ? 

$ 17:11:3 Should your boastings make men hold their peace ? When you mock , shall no man make you ashamed ? 

$ 17:11:4 For you say , <' My doctrine is pure . I am clean in your eyes . >' 

$ 17:11:5 But oh that God would speak , and open his lips against you , 

$ 17:11:6 that he would show you the secrets of wisdom ! For true wisdom has two sides . Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves . 

$ 17:11:7 <" Can you fathom the mystery of God ? Or can you probe the limits of the Almighty ? 

$ 17:11:8 They are high as heaven . What can you do ? They are deeper than Sheol . What can you know ? 

$ 17:11:9 Its measure is longer than the earth , and broader than the sea . 

$ 17:11:10 If he passes by , or confines , or convenes a court , then who can oppose him ? 

$ 17:11:11 For he knows false men . He sees iniquity also , even though he doesn't consider it . 

$ 17:11:12 An empty - headed man becomes wise when a man is born as a wild donkey's colt . 

$ 17:11:13 <" If you set your heart aright , stretch out your hands toward him . 

$ 17:11:14 If iniquity is in your hand , put it far away . Don't let unrighteousness dwell in your tents . 

$ 17:11:15 Surely then you shall lift up your face without spot ; Yes , you shall be steadfast , and shall not fear : 

$ 17:11:16 for you shall forget your misery . You shall remember it like waters that have passed away . 

$ 17:11:17 Life shall be clearer than the noonday . Though there is darkness , it shall be as the morning . 

$ 17:11:18 You shall be secure , because there is hope . Yes , you shall search , and shall take your rest in safety . 

$ 17:11:19 Also you shall lie down , and no one shall make you afraid . Yes , many shall court your favor . 

$ 17:11:20 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail . They shall have no way to flee . Their hope shall be the giving up of the spirit . >" 


$ 17:12:1 Then Job answered , 

$ 17:12:2 <" No doubt , but you are the people , and wisdom shall die with you . 

$ 17:12:3 But I have understanding as well as you ; I am not inferior to you . Yes , who doesn't know such things as these ? 

$ 17:12:4 I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor , I , who called on God , and he answered . The just , the blameless man is a joke . 

$ 17:12:5 In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune . It is ready for them whose foot slips . 

$ 17:12:6 The tents of robbers prosper . Those who provoke God are secure , who carry their God in their hands . 

$ 17:12:7 <" But ask the animals , now , and they shall teach you ; the birds of the sky , and they shall tell you . 

$ 17:12:8 Or speak to the earth , and it shall teach you . The fish of the sea shall declare to you . 

$ 17:12:9 Who doesn't know that in all these , Yahweh's hand has done this , 

$ 17:12:10 in whose hand is the life of every living thing , and the breath of all mankind ? 

$ 17:12:11 Doesn't the ear try words , even as the palate tastes its food ? 

$ 17:12:12 With aged men is wisdom , in length of days understanding . 

$ 17:12:13 <" With God is wisdom and might . He has counsel and understanding . 

$ 17:12:14 Behold , he breaks down , and it can't be built again . He imprisons a man , and there can be no release . 

$ 17:12:15 Behold , he withholds the waters , and they dry up . Again , he sends them out , and they overturn the earth . 

$ 17:12:16 With him is strength and wisdom . The deceived and the deceiver are his . 

$ 17:12:17 He leads counselors away stripped . He makes judges fools . 

$ 17:12:18 He loosens the bond of kings . He binds their waist with a belt . 

$ 17:12:19 He leads priests away stripped , and overthrows the mighty . 

$ 17:12:20 He removes the speech of those who are trusted , and takes away the understanding of the elders . 

$ 17:12:21 He pours contempt on princes , and loosens the belt of the strong . 

$ 17:12:22 He uncovers deep things out of darkness , and brings out to light the shadow of death . 

$ 17:12:23 He increases the nations , and he destroys them . He enlarges the nations , and he leads them captive . 

$ 17:12:24 He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth , and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way . 

$ 17:12:25 They grope in the dark without light . He makes them stagger like a drunken man . 


$ 17:13:1 <" Behold , my eye has seen all this . My ear has heard and understood it . 

$ 17:13:2 What you know , I know also . I am not inferior to you . 

$ 17:13:3 <" Surely I would speak to the Almighty . I desire to reason with God . 

$ 17:13:4 But you are forgers of lies . You are all physicians of no value . 

$ 17:13:5 Oh that you would be completely silent ! Then you would be wise . 

$ 17:13:6 Hear now my reasoning . Listen to the pleadings of my lips . 

$ 17:13:7 Will you speak unrighteously for God , and talk deceitfully for him ? 

$ 17:13:8 Will you show partiality to him ? Will you contend for God ? 

$ 17:13:9 Is it good that he should search you out ? Or as one deceives a man , will you deceive him ? 

$ 17:13:10 He will surely reprove you , if you secretly show partiality . 

$ 17:13:11 Shall not his majesty make you afraid , And his dread fall on you ? 

$ 17:13:12 Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes , Your defenses are defenses of clay . 

$ 17:13:13 <" Be silent , leave me alone , that I may speak . Let come on me what will . 

$ 17:13:14 Why should I take my flesh in my teeth , and put my life in my hand ? 

$ 17:13:15 Behold , he will kill me . I have no hope . Nevertheless , I will maintain my ways before him . 

$ 17:13:16 This also shall be my salvation , that a godless man shall not come before him . 

$ 17:13:17 Hear diligently my speech . Let my declaration be in your ears . 

$ 17:13:18 See now , I have set my cause in order . I know that I am righteous . 

$ 17:13:19 Who is he who will contend with me ? For then would I hold my peace and give up the spirit . 

$ 17:13:20 <" Only don't do two things to me ; then I will not hide myself from your face : 

$ 17:13:21 withdraw your hand far from me ; and don't let your terror make me afraid . 

$ 17:13:22 Then call , and I will answer ; or let me speak , and you answer me . 

$ 17:13:23 How many are my iniquities and sins ? Make me know my disobedience and my sin . 

$ 17:13:24 Why hide you your face , and hold me for your enemy ? 

$ 17:13:25 Will you harass a driven leaf ? Will you pursue the dry stubble ? 

$ 17:13:26 For you write bitter things against me , and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth : 

$ 17:13:27 You also put my feet in the stocks , and mark all my paths . You set a bound to the soles of my feet , 

$ 17:13:28 though I am decaying like a rotten thing , like a garment that is moth - eaten . 


$ 17:14:1 <" Man , who is born of a woman , is of few days , and full of trouble . 

$ 17:14:2 He grows up like a flower , and is cut down . He also flees like a shadow , and doesn't continue . 

$ 17:14:3 Do you open your eyes on such a one , and bring me into judgment with you ? 

$ 17:14:4 Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean ? Not one . 

$ 17:14:5 Seeing his days are determined , the number of his months is with you , and you have appointed his bounds that he can't pass ; 

$ 17:14:6 Look away from him , that he may rest , until he shall accomplish , as a hireling , his day . 

$ 17:14:7 <" For there is hope for a tree , If it is cut down , that it will sprout again , that the tender branch of it will not cease . 

$ 17:14:8 Though its root grows old in the earth , and its stock dies in the ground , 

$ 17:14:9 yet through the scent of water it will bud , and sprout boughs like a plant . 

$ 17:14:10 But man dies , and is laid low . Yes , man gives up the spirit , and where is he ? 

$ 17:14:11 As the waters fail from the sea , and the river wastes and dries up , 

$ 17:14:12 so man lies down and doesn't rise . Until the heavens are no more , they shall not awake , nor be roused out of their sleep . 

$ 17:14:13 <" Oh that you would hide me in Sheol , that you would keep me secret , until your wrath is past , that you would appoint me a set time , and remember me ! 

$ 17:14:14 If a man dies , shall he live again ? All the days of my warfare would I wait , until my release should come . 

$ 17:14:15 You would call , and I would answer you . You would have a desire to the work of your hands . 

$ 17:14:16 But now you count my steps . Don't you watch over my sin ? 

$ 17:14:17 My disobedience is sealed up in a bag . You fasten up my iniquity . 

$ 17:14:18 <" But the mountain falling comes to nothing . The rock is removed out of its place ; 

$ 17:14:19 The waters wear the stones . The torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth . So you destroy the hope of man . 

$ 17:14:20 You forever prevail against him , and he departs . You change his face , and send him away . 

$ 17:14:21 His sons come to honor , and he doesn't know it . They are brought low , but he doesn't perceive it of them . 

$ 17:14:22 But his flesh on him has pain , and his soul within him mourns . >" 


$ 17:15:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered , 

$ 17:15:2 <" Should a wise man answer with vain knowledge , and fill himself with the east wind ? 

$ 17:15:3 Should he reason with unprofitable talk , or with speeches with which he can do no good ? 

$ 17:15:4 Yes , you do away with fear , and hinder devotion before God . 

$ 17:15:5 For your iniquity teaches your mouth , and you choose the language of the crafty . 

$ 17:15:6 Your own mouth condemns you , and not I . Yes , your own lips testify against you . 

$ 17:15:7 <" Are you the first man who was born ? Or were you brought out before the hills ? 

$ 17:15:8 Have you heard the secret counsel of God ? Do you limit wisdom to yourself ? 

$ 17:15:9 What do you know , that we don't know ? What do you understand , which is not in us ? 

$ 17:15:10 With us are both the gray - headed and the very aged men , much elder than your father . 

$ 17:15:11 Are the consolations of God too small for you , even the word that is gentle toward you ? 

$ 17:15:12 Why does your heart carry you away ? Why do your eyes flash , 

$ 17:15:13 That you turn your spirit against God , and let such words go out of your mouth ? 

$ 17:15:14 What is man , that he should be clean ? What is he who is born of a woman , that he should be righteous ? 

$ 17:15:15 Behold , he puts no trust in his holy ones . Yes , the heavens are not clean in his sight ; 

$ 17:15:16 how much less one who is abominable and corrupt , a man who drinks iniquity like water ! 

$ 17:15:17 <" I will show you , listen to me ; that which I have seen I will declare 

$ 17:15:18 ( which wise men have told by their fathers , and have not hidden it ; 

$ 17:15:19 to whom alone the land was given , and no stranger passed among them ) : 

$ 17:15:20 the wicked man writhes in pain all his days , even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor . 

$ 17:15:21 A sound of terrors is in his ears . In prosperity the destroyer shall come on him . 

$ 17:15:22 He doesn't believe that he shall return out of darkness . He is waited for by the sword . 

$ 17:15:23 He wanders abroad for bread , saying , <' Where is it ? >' He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand . 

$ 17:15:24 Distress and anguish make him afraid . They prevail against him , as a king ready to the battle . 

$ 17:15:25 Because he has stretched out his hand against God , and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty ; 

$ 17:15:26 he runs at him with a stiff neck , with the thick shields of his bucklers ; 

$ 17:15:27 because he has covered his face with his fatness , and gathered fat on his thighs . 

$ 17:15:28 He has lived in desolate cities , in houses which no one inhabited , which were ready to become heaps . 

$ 17:15:29 He shall not be rich , neither shall his substance continue , neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth . 

$ 17:15:30 He shall not depart out of darkness . The flame shall dry up his branches . By the breath of God's mouth shall he go away . 

$ 17:15:31 Let him not trust in emptiness , deceiving himself ; for emptiness shall be his reward . 

$ 17:15:32 It shall be accomplished before his time . His branch shall not be green . 

$ 17:15:33 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine , and shall cast off his flower as the olive tree . 

$ 17:15:34 For the company of the godless shall be barren , and fire shall consume the tents of bribery . 

$ 17:15:35 They conceive mischief , and produce iniquity . Their heart prepares deceit . >" 


$ 17:16:1 Then Job answered , 

$ 17:16:2 <" I have heard many such things . You are all miserable comforters ! 

$ 17:16:3 Shall vain words have an end ? Or what provokes you that you answer ? 

$ 17:16:4 I also could speak as you do . If your soul were in my soul's place , I could join words together against you , and shake my head at you , 

$ 17:16:5 but I would strengthen you with my mouth . The solace of my lips would relieve you . 

$ 17:16:6 <" Though I speak , my grief is not subsided . Though I forbear , what am I eased ? 

$ 17:16:7 But now , God , you have surely worn me out . You have made desolate all my company . 

$ 17:16:8 You have shriveled me up . This is a witness against me . My leanness rises up against me . It testifies to my face . 

$ 17:16:9 He has torn me in his wrath , and persecuted me . He has gnashed on me with his teeth . My adversary sharpens his eyes on me . 

$ 17:16:10 They have gaped on me with their mouth . They have struck me on the cheek reproachfully . They gather themselves together against me . 

$ 17:16:11 God delivers me to the ungodly , and casts me into the hands of the wicked . 

$ 17:16:12 I was at ease , and he broke me apart . Yes , he has taken me by the neck , and dashed me to pieces . He has also set me up for his target . 

$ 17:16:13 His archers surround me . He splits my kidneys apart , and does not spare . He pours out my gall on the ground . 

$ 17:16:14 He breaks me with breach on breach . He runs on me like a giant . 

$ 17:16:15 I have sewed sackcloth on my skin , and have thrust my horn in the dust . 

$ 17:16:16 My face is red with weeping . Deep darkness is on my eyelids . 

$ 17:16:17 Although there is no violence in my hands , and my prayer is pure . 

$ 17:16:18 <" Earth , don't cover my blood . Let my cry have no place to rest . 

$ 17:16:19 Even now , behold , my witness is in heaven . He who vouches for me is on high . 

$ 17:16:20 My friends scoff at me . My eyes pour out tears to God , 

$ 17:16:21 that he would maintain the right of a man with God , of a son of man with his neighbor ! 

$ 17:16:22 For when a few years have come , I shall go the way of no return . 


$ 17:17:1 <" My spirit is consumed . My days are extinct , And the grave is ready for me . 

$ 17:17:2 Surely there are mockers with me . My eye dwells on their provocation . 

$ 17:17:3 <" Now give a pledge , be collateral for me with yourself . Who is there who will strike hands with me ? 

$ 17:17:4 For you have hidden their heart from understanding , Therefore you shall not exalt them . 

$ 17:17:5 He who denounces his friends for plunder , Even the eyes of his children shall fail . 

$ 17:17:6 <" But he has made me a byword of the people . They spit in my face . 

$ 17:17:7 My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow . All my members are as a shadow . 

$ 17:17:8 Upright men shall be astonished at this . The innocent shall stir up himself against the godless . 

$ 17:17:9 Yet shall the righteous hold on his way . He who has clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger . 

$ 17:17:10 But as for you all , come on now again ; I shall not find a wise man among you . 

$ 17:17:11 My days are past , my plans are broken off , as are the thoughts of my heart . 

$ 17:17:12 They change the night into day , saying <' The light is near >' in the presence of darkness . 

$ 17:17:13 If I look for Sheol as my house , if I have spread my couch in the darkness , 

$ 17:17:14 If I have said to corruption , <' You are my father ; >' to the worm , <' My mother , >' and <' my sister ; >' 

$ 17:17:15 where then is my hope ? as for my hope , who shall see it ? 

$ 17:17:16 Shall it go down with me to the gates of Sheol , or descend together into the dust ? >" 


$ 17:18:1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered , 

$ 17:18:2 <" How long will you hunt for words ? Consider , and afterwards we will speak . 

$ 17:18:3 Why are we counted as animals , which have become unclean in your sight ? 

$ 17:18:4 You who tear yourself in your anger , shall the earth be forsaken for you ? Or shall the rock be removed out of its place ? 

$ 17:18:5 <" Yes , the light of the wicked shall be put out , The spark of his fire shall not shine . 

$ 17:18:6 The light shall be dark in his tent . His lamp above him shall be put out . 

$ 17:18:7 The steps of his strength shall be shortened . His own counsel shall cast him down . 

$ 17:18:8 For he is cast into a net by his own feet , and he wanders into its mesh . 

$ 17:18:9 A snare will take him by the heel . A trap will catch him . 

$ 17:18:10 A noose is hidden for him in the ground , a trap for him on the path . 

$ 17:18:11 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side , and shall chase him at his heels . 

$ 17:18:12 His strength shall be famished . Calamity shall be ready at his side . 

$ 17:18:13 The members of his body shall be devoured . The firstborn of death shall devour his members . 

$ 17:18:14 He shall be rooted out of the security of his tent . He shall be brought to the king of terrors . 

$ 17:18:15 There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his . Sulfur shall be scattered on his habitation . 

$ 17:18:16 His roots shall be dried up beneath . Above shall his branch be cut off . 

$ 17:18:17 His memory shall perish from the earth . He shall have no name in the street . 

$ 17:18:18 He shall be driven from light into darkness , and chased out of the world . 

$ 17:18:19 He shall have neither son nor grandson among his people , nor any remaining where he lived . 

$ 17:18:20 Those who come after shall be astonished at his day , as those who went before were frightened . 

$ 17:18:21 Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous . This is the place of him who doesn't know God . >" 


$ 17:19:1 Then Job answered , 

$ 17:19:2 <" How long will you torment me , and crush me with words ? 

$ 17:19:3 You have reproached me ten times . You aren't ashamed that you attack me . 

$ 17:19:4 If it is true that I have erred , my error remains with myself . 

$ 17:19:5 If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me , and plead against me my reproach ; 

$ 17:19:6 know now that God has subverted me , and has surrounded me with his net . 

$ 17:19:7 <" Behold , I cry out of wrong , but I am not heard . I cry for help , but there is no justice . 

$ 17:19:8 He has walled up my way so that I can't pass , and has set darkness in my paths . 

$ 17:19:9 He has stripped me of my glory , and taken the crown from my head . 

$ 17:19:10 He has broken me down on every side , and I am gone . My hope he has plucked up like a tree . 

$ 17:19:11 He has also kindled his wrath against me . He counts me among his adversaries . 

$ 17:19:12 His troops come on together , build a siege ramp against me , and encamp around my tent . 

$ 17:19:13 <" He has put my brothers far from me . My acquaintances are wholly estranged from me . 

$ 17:19:14 My relatives have gone away . My familiar friends have forgotten me . 

$ 17:19:15 Those who dwell in my house and my maids consider me a stranger . I am an alien in their sight . 

$ 17:19:16 I call to my servant , and he gives me no answer . I beg him with my mouth . 

$ 17:19:17 My breath is offensive to my wife . I am loathsome to the children of my own mother . 

$ 17:19:18 Even young children despise me . If I arise , they speak against me . 

$ 17:19:19 All my familiar friends abhor me . They whom I loved have turned against me . 

$ 17:19:20 My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh . I have escaped by the skin of my teeth . 

$ 17:19:21 <" Have pity on me , have pity on me , you my friends ; for the hand of God has touched me . 

$ 17:19:22 Why do you persecute me as God , and are not satisfied with my flesh ? 

$ 17:19:23 <" Oh that my words were now written ! Oh that they were inscribed in a book ! 

$ 17:19:24 That with an iron pen and lead they were engraved in the rock forever ! 

$ 17:19:25 But as for me , I know that my Redeemer lives . In the end , he will stand upon the earth . 

$ 17:19:26 After my skin is destroyed , then in my flesh shall I see God , 

$ 17:19:27 Whom I , even I , shall see on my side . My eyes shall see , and not as a stranger . <" My heart is consumed within me . 

$ 17:19:28 If you say , <' How we will persecute him ! >' because the root of the matter is found in me , 

$ 17:19:29 be afraid of the sword , for wrath brings the punishments of the sword , that you may know there is a judgment . >" 


$ 17:20:1 Then Zophar the Naamathite answered , 

$ 17:20:2 <" Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me , even by reason of my haste that is in me . 

$ 17:20:3 I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame . The spirit of my understanding answers me . 

$ 17:20:4 Don't you know this from old time , since man was placed on earth , 

$ 17:20:5 that the triumphing of the wicked is short , the joy of the godless but for a moment ? 

$ 17:20:6 Though his height mount up to the heavens , and his head reach to the clouds , 

$ 17:20:7 yet he shall perish forever like his own dung . Those who have seen him shall say , <' Where is he ? >' 

$ 17:20:8 He shall fly away as a dream , and shall not be found . Yes , he shall be chased away like a vision of the night . 

$ 17:20:9 The eye which saw him shall see him no more , neither shall his place any more see him . 

$ 17:20:10 His children shall seek the favor of the poor . His hands shall give back his wealth . 

$ 17:20:11 His bones are full of his youth , but youth shall lie down with him in the dust . 

$ 17:20:12 <" Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth , though he hide it under his tongue , 

$ 17:20:13 though he spare it , and will not let it go , but keep it still within his mouth ; 

$ 17:20:14 yet his food in his bowels is turned . It is cobra venom within him . 

$ 17:20:15 He has swallowed down riches , and he shall vomit them up again . God will cast them out of his belly . 

$ 17:20:16 He shall suck cobra venom . The viper's tongue shall kill him . 

$ 17:20:17 He shall not look at the rivers , the flowing streams of honey and butter . 

$ 17:20:18 That for which he labored he shall restore , and shall not swallow it down . According to the substance that he has gotten , he shall not rejoice . 

$ 17:20:19 For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor . He has violently taken away a house , and he shall not build it up . 

$ 17:20:20 <" Because he knew no quietness within him , he shall not save anything of that in which he delights . 

$ 17:20:21 There was nothing left that he didn't devour , therefore his prosperity shall not endure . 

$ 17:20:22 In the fullness of his sufficiency , distress shall overtake him . The hand of everyone who is in misery shall come on him . 

$ 17:20:23 When he is about to fill his belly , God will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him . It will rain on him while he is eating . 

$ 17:20:24 He shall flee from the iron weapon . The bronze arrow shall strike him through . 

$ 17:20:25 He draws it out , and it comes out of his body . Yes , the glittering point comes out of his liver . Terrors are on him . 

$ 17:20:26 All darkness is laid up for his treasures . An unfanned fire shall devour him . It shall consume that which is left in his tent . 

$ 17:20:27 The heavens shall reveal his iniquity . The earth shall rise up against him . 

$ 17:20:28 The increase of his house shall depart . They shall rush away in the day of his wrath . 

$ 17:20:29 This is the portion of a wicked man from God , the heritage appointed to him by God . >" 


$ 17:21:1 Then Job answered , 

$ 17:21:2 <" Listen diligently to my speech . Let this be your consolation . 

$ 17:21:3 Allow me , and I also will speak ; After I have spoken , mock on . 

$ 17:21:4 As for me , is my complaint to man ? Why shouldn't I be impatient ? 

$ 17:21:5 Look at me , and be astonished . Lay your hand on your mouth . 

$ 17:21:6 When I remember , I am troubled . Horror takes hold of my flesh . 

$ 17:21:7 <" Why do the wicked live , become old , yes , and grow mighty in power ? 

$ 17:21:8 Their child is established with them in their sight , their offspring before their eyes . 

$ 17:21:9 Their houses are safe from fear , neither is the rod of God upon them . 

$ 17:21:10 Their bulls breed without fail . Their cows calve , and don't miscarry . 

$ 17:21:11 They send out their little ones like a flock . Their children dance . 

$ 17:21:12 They sing to the tambourine and harp , and rejoice at the sound of the pipe . 

$ 17:21:13 They spend their days in prosperity . In an instant they go down to Sheol . 

$ 17:21:14 They tell God , <' Depart from us , for we don't want to know about your ways . 

$ 17:21:15 What is the Almighty , that we should serve him ? What profit should we have , if we pray to him ? >' 

$ 17:21:16 Behold , their prosperity is not in their hand . The counsel of the wicked is far from me . 

$ 17:21:17 <" How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out , that their calamity comes on them , that God distributes sorrows in his anger ? 

$ 17:21:18 How often is it that they are as stubble before the wind , as chaff that the storm carries away ? 

$ 17:21:19 You say , <' God lays up his iniquity for his children . >' Let him recompense it to himself , that he may know it . 

$ 17:21:20 Let his own eyes see his destruction . Let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty . 

$ 17:21:21 For what does he care for his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off ? 

$ 17:21:22 <" Shall any teach God knowledge , since he judges those who are high ? 

$ 17:21:23 One dies in his full strength , being wholly at ease and quiet . 

$ 17:21:24 His pails are full of milk . The marrow of his bones is moistened . 

$ 17:21:25 Another dies in bitterness of soul , and never tastes of good . 

$ 17:21:26 They lie down alike in the dust . The worm covers them . 

$ 17:21:27 <" Behold , I know your thoughts , the plans with which you would wrong me . 

$ 17:21:28 For you say , <' Where is the house of the prince ? Where is the tent in which the wicked lived ? >' 

$ 17:21:29 Haven't you asked wayfaring men ? Don't you know their evidences , 

$ 17:21:30 that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity , That they are led out to the day of wrath ? 

$ 17:21:31 Who shall declare his way to his face ? Who shall repay him what he has done ? 

$ 17:21:32 Yet he will be borne to the grave . Men shall keep watch over the tomb . 

$ 17:21:33 The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him . All men shall draw after him , as there were innumerable before him . 

$ 17:21:34 So how can you comfort me with nonsense , because in your answers there remains only falsehood ? >" 


$ 17:22:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered , 

$ 17:22:2 <" Can a man be profitable to God ? Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself . 

$ 17:22:3 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty , that you are righteous ? Or does it benefit him , that you make your ways perfect ? 

$ 17:22:4 Is it for your piety that he reproves you , that he enters with you into judgment ? 

$ 17:22:5 Isn't your wickedness great ? Neither is there any end to your iniquities . 

$ 17:22:6 For you have taken pledges from your brother for nothing , and stripped the naked of their clothing . 

$ 17:22:7 You haven't given water to the weary to drink , and you have withheld bread from the hungry . 

$ 17:22:8 But as for the mighty man , he had the earth . The honorable man , he lived in it . 

$ 17:22:9 You have sent widows away empty , and the arms of the fatherless have been broken . 

$ 17:22:10 Therefore snares are around you . Sudden fear troubles you , 

$ 17:22:11 or darkness , so that you can not see , and floods of waters cover you . 

$ 17:22:12 <" Isn't God in the heights of heaven ? See the height of the stars , how high they are ! 

$ 17:22:13 You say , <' What does God know ? Can he judge through the thick darkness ? 

$ 17:22:14 Thick clouds are a covering to him , so that he doesn't see . He walks on the vault of the sky . >' 

$ 17:22:15 Will you keep the old way , which wicked men have trodden , 

$ 17:22:16 who were snatched away before their time , whose foundation was poured out as a stream , 

$ 17:22:17 who said to God , <' Depart from us ; >' and , <' What can the Almighty do for us ? >' 

$ 17:22:18 Yet he filled their houses with good things , but the counsel of the wicked is far from me . 

$ 17:22:19 The righteous see it , and are glad . The innocent ridicule them , 

$ 17:22:20 saying , <' Surely those who rose up against us are cut off . The fire has consumed their remnant . >' 

$ 17:22:21 <" Acquaint yourself with him , now , and be at peace . Thereby good shall come to you . 

$ 17:22:22 Please receive instruction from his mouth , and lay up his words in your heart . 

$ 17:22:23 If you return to the Almighty , you shall be built up , if you put away unrighteousness far from your tents . 

$ 17:22:24 Lay your treasure in the dust , the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks . 

$ 17:22:25 The Almighty will be your treasure , and precious silver to you . 

$ 17:22:26 For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty , and shall lift up your face to God . 

$ 17:22:27 You shall make your prayer to him , and he will hear you . You shall pay your vows . 

$ 17:22:28 You shall also decree a thing , and it shall be established to you . Light shall shine on your ways . 

$ 17:22:29 When they cast down , you shall say , <' be lifted up . >' He will save the humble person . 

$ 17:22:30 He will even deliver him who is not innocent . Yes , he shall be delivered through the cleanness of your hands . >" 


$ 17:23:1 Then Job answered , 

$ 17:23:2 <" Even today my complaint is rebellious . His hand is heavy in spite of my groaning . 

$ 17:23:3 Oh that I knew where I might find him ! That I might come even to his seat ! 

$ 17:23:4 I would set my cause in order before him , and fill my mouth with arguments . 

$ 17:23:5 I would know the words which he would answer me , and understand what he would tell me . 

$ 17:23:6 Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power ? No , but he would listen to me . 

$ 17:23:7 There the upright might reason with him , so I should be delivered forever from my judge . 

$ 17:23:8 <" If I go east , he is not there ; if west , I can't find him ; 

$ 17:23:9 He works to the north , but I can't see him . He turns south , but I can't catch a glimpse of him . 

$ 17:23:10 But he knows the way that I take . When he has tried me , I shall come out like gold . 

$ 17:23:11 My foot has held fast to his steps . I have kept his way , and not turned away . 

$ 17:23:12 I haven't gone back from the commandment of his lips . I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food . 

$ 17:23:13 But he stands alone , and who can oppose him ? What his soul desires , even that he does . 

$ 17:23:14 For he performs that which is appointed for me . Many such things are with him . 

$ 17:23:15 Therefore I am terrified at his presence . When I consider , I am afraid of him . 

$ 17:23:16 For God has made my heart faint . The Almighty has terrified me . 

$ 17:23:17 Because I was not cut off before the darkness , neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face . 


$ 17:24:1 <" Why aren't times laid up by the Almighty ? Why don't those who know him see his days ? 

$ 17:24:2 There are people who remove the landmarks . They violently take away flocks , and feed them . 

$ 17:24:3 They drive away the donkey of the fatherless , and they take the widow's ox for a pledge . 

$ 17:24:4 They turn the needy out of the way . The poor of the earth all hide themselves . 

$ 17:24:5 Behold , as wild donkeys in the desert , they go out to their work , seeking diligently for food . The wilderness yields them bread for their children . 

$ 17:24:6 They cut their food in the field . They glean the vineyard of the wicked . 

$ 17:24:7 They lie all night naked without clothing , and have no covering in the cold . 

$ 17:24:8 They are wet with the showers of the mountains , and embrace the rock for lack of a shelter . 

$ 17:24:9 There are those who pluck the fatherless from the breast , and take a pledge of the poor , 

$ 17:24:10 So that they go around naked without clothing . Being hungry , they carry the sheaves . 

$ 17:24:11 They make oil within the walls of these men . They tread wine presses , and suffer thirst . 

$ 17:24:12 From out of the populous city , men groan . The soul of the wounded cries out , yet God doesn't regard the folly . 

$ 17:24:13 <" These are of those who rebel against the light . They don't know its ways , nor stay in its paths . 

$ 17:24:14 The murderer rises with the light . He kills the poor and needy . In the night he is like a thief . 

$ 17:24:15 The eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight , saying , <' No eye shall see me . >' He disguises his face . 

$ 17:24:16 In the dark they dig through houses . They shut themselves up in the daytime . They don't know the light . 

$ 17:24:17 For the morning is to all of them like thick darkness , for they know the terrors of the thick darkness . 

$ 17:24:18 <" They are foam on the surface of the waters . Their portion is cursed in the earth . They don't turn into the way of the vineyards . 

$ 17:24:19 Drought and heat consume the snow waters , so does Sheol those who have sinned . 

$ 17:24:20 The womb shall forget him . The worm shall feed sweetly on him . He shall be no more remembered . Unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree . 

$ 17:24:21 He devours the barren who don't bear . He shows no kindness to the widow . 

$ 17:24:22 Yet God preserves the mighty by his power . He rises up who has no assurance of life . 

$ 17:24:23 God gives them security , and they rest in it . His eyes are on their ways . 

$ 17:24:24 They are exalted ; yet a little while , and they are gone . Yes , they are brought low , they are taken out of the way as all others , and are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain . 

$ 17:24:25 If it isn't so now , who will prove me a liar , and make my speech worth nothing ? >" 


$ 17:25:1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered , 

$ 17:25:2 <" Dominion and fear are with him . He makes peace in his high places . 

$ 17:25:3 Can his armies be counted ? On whom does his light not arise ? 

$ 17:25:4 How then can man be just with God ? Or how can he who is born of a woman be clean ? 

$ 17:25:5 Behold , even the moon has no brightness , and the stars are not pure in his sight ; 

$ 17:25:6 How much less man , who is a worm , the son of man , who is a worm ! >" 


$ 17:26:1 Then Job answered , 

$ 17:26:2 <" How have you helped him who is without power ! How have you saved the arm that has no strength ! 

$ 17:26:3 How have you counseled him who has no wisdom , and plentifully declared sound knowledge ! 

$ 17:26:4 To whom have you uttered words ? Whose spirit came out of you ? 

$ 17:26:5 <" The departed spirits tremble , those beneath the waters and all that live in them . 

$ 17:26:6 Sheol is naked before God , and Abaddon has no covering . 

$ 17:26:7 He stretches out the north over empty space , and hangs the earth on nothing . 

$ 17:26:8 He binds up the waters in his thick clouds , and the cloud is not burst under them . 

$ 17:26:9 He encloses the face of his throne , and spreads his cloud on it . 

$ 17:26:10 He has described a boundary on the surface of the waters , and to the confines of light and darkness . 

$ 17:26:11 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his rebuke . 

$ 17:26:12 He stirs up the sea with his power , and by his understanding he strikes through Rahab . 

$ 17:26:13 By his Spirit the heavens are garnished . His hand has pierced the swift serpent . 

$ 17:26:14 Behold , these are but the outskirts of his ways . How small a whisper do we hear of him ! But the thunder of his power who can understand ? >" 


$ 17:27:1 Job again took up his parable , and said , 

$ 17:27:2 <" As God lives , who has taken away my right , the Almighty , who has made my soul bitter 

$ 17:27:3 ( for the length of my life is still in me , and the spirit of God is in my nostrils ) ; 

$ 17:27:4 surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness , neither shall my tongue utter deceit . 

$ 17:27:5 Far be it from me that I should justify you . Until I die I will not put away my integrity from me . 

$ 17:27:6 I hold fast to my righteousness , and will not let it go . My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live . 

$ 17:27:7 <" Let my enemy be as the wicked . Let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous . 

$ 17:27:8 For what is the hope of the godless , when he is cut off , when God takes away his life ? 

$ 17:27:9 Will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him ? 

$ 17:27:10 Will he delight himself in the Almighty , and call on God at all times ? 

$ 17:27:11 I will teach you about the hand of God . I will not conceal that which is with the Almighty . 

$ 17:27:12 Behold , all of you have seen it yourselves ; why then have you become altogether vain ? 

$ 17:27:13 <" This is the portion of a wicked man with God , the heritage of oppressors , which they receive from the Almighty . 

$ 17:27:14 If his children are multiplied , it is for the sword . His offspring shall not be satisfied with bread . 

$ 17:27:15 Those who remain of him shall be buried in death . His widows shall make no lamentation . 

$ 17:27:16 Though he heap up silver as the dust , and prepare clothing as the clay ; 

$ 17:27:17 he may prepare it , but the just shall put it on , and the innocent shall divide the silver . 

$ 17:27:18 He builds his house as the moth , as a booth which the watchman makes . 

$ 17:27:19 He lies down rich , but he shall not do so again . He opens his eyes , and he is not . 

$ 17:27:20 Terrors overtake him like waters . A storm steals him away in the night . 

$ 17:27:21 The east wind carries him away , and he departs . It sweeps him out of his place . 

$ 17:27:22 For it hurls at him , and does not spare , as he flees away from his hand . 

$ 17:27:23 Men shall clap their hands at him , and shall hiss him out of his place . 


$ 17:28:1 <" Surely there is a mine for silver , and a place for gold which they refine . 

$ 17:28:2 Iron is taken out of the earth , and copper is smelted out of the ore . 

$ 17:28:3 Man sets an end to darkness , and searches out , to the furthest bound , the stones of obscurity and of thick darkness . 

$ 17:28:4 He breaks open a shaft away from where people live . They are forgotten by the foot . They hang far from men , they swing back and forth . 

$ 17:28:5 As for the earth , out of it comes bread ; Underneath it is turned up as it were by fire . 

$ 17:28:6 Sapphires come from its rocks . It has dust of gold . 

$ 17:28:7 That path no bird of prey knows , neither has the falcon's eye seen it . 

$ 17:28:8 The proud animals have not trodden it , nor has the fierce lion passed by there . 

$ 17:28:9 He puts his hand on the flinty rock , and he overturns the mountains by the roots . 

$ 17:28:10 He cuts out channels among the rocks . His eye sees every precious thing . 

$ 17:28:11 He binds the streams that they don't trickle . The thing that is hidden he brings out to light . 

$ 17:28:12 <" But where shall wisdom be found ? Where is the place of understanding ? 

$ 17:28:13 Man doesn't know its price ; Neither is it found in the land of the living . 

$ 17:28:14 The deep says , <' It isn't in me . >' The sea says , <' It isn't with me . >' 

$ 17:28:15 It can't be gotten for gold , neither shall silver be weighed for its price . 

$ 17:28:16 It can't be valued with the gold of Ophir , with the precious onyx , or the sapphire . 

$ 17:28:17 Gold and glass can't equal it , neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold . 

$ 17:28:18 No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal . Yes , the price of wisdom is above rubies . 

$ 17:28:19 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it , Neither shall it be valued with pure gold . 

$ 17:28:20 Where then does wisdom come from ? Where is the place of understanding ? 

$ 17:28:21 Seeing it is hidden from the eyes of all living , and kept close from the birds of the sky . 

$ 17:28:22 Destruction and Death say , <' We have heard a rumor of it with our ears . >' 

$ 17:28:23 <" God understands its way , and he knows its place . 

$ 17:28:24 For he looks to the ends of the earth , and sees under the whole sky . 

$ 17:28:25 He establishes the force of the wind . Yes , he measures out the waters by measure . 

$ 17:28:26 When he made a decree for the rain , and a way for the lightning of the thunder ; 

$ 17:28:27 then he saw it , and declared it . He established it , yes , and searched it out . 

$ 17:28:28 To man he said , <' Behold , the fear of the Lord , that is wisdom . To depart from evil is understanding . >' >" 


$ 17:29:1 Job again took up his parable , and said , 

$ 17:29:2 <" Oh that I were as in the months of old , as in the days when God watched over me ; 

$ 17:29:3 when his lamp shone on my head , and by his light I walked through darkness , 

$ 17:29:4 as I was in the ripeness of my days , when the friendship of God was in my tent , 

$ 17:29:5 when the Almighty was yet with me , and my children were around me , 

$ 17:29:6 when my steps were washed with butter , and the rock poured out streams of oil for me , 

$ 17:29:7 when I went out to the city gate , when I prepared my seat in the street . 

$ 17:29:8 The young men saw me and hid themselves . The aged rose up and stood . 

$ 17:29:9 The princes refrained from talking , and laid their hand on their mouth . 

$ 17:29:10 The voice of the nobles was hushed , and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth . 

$ 17:29:11 For when the ear heard me , then it blessed me ; and when the eye saw me , it commended me : 

$ 17:29:12 Because I delivered the poor who cried , and the fatherless also , who had no one to help him , 

$ 17:29:13 the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me , and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy . 

$ 17:29:14 I put on righteousness , and it clothed me . My justice was as a robe and a diadem . 

$ 17:29:15 I was eyes to the blind , and feet to the lame . 

$ 17:29:16 I was a father to the needy . The cause of him who I didn't know , I searched out . 

$ 17:29:17 I broke the jaws of the unrighteous , and plucked the prey out of his teeth . 

$ 17:29:18 Then I said , <' I shall die in my own house , I shall count my days as the sand . 

$ 17:29:19 My root is spread out to the waters . The dew lies all night on my branch . 

$ 17:29:20 My glory is fresh in me . My bow is renewed in my hand . >' 

$ 17:29:21 <" Men listened to me , waited , and kept silence for my counsel . 

$ 17:29:22 After my words they didn't speak again . My speech fell on them . 

$ 17:29:23 They waited for me as for the rain . Their mouths drank as with the spring rain . 

$ 17:29:24 I smiled on them when they had no confidence . They didn't reject the light of my face . 

$ 17:29:25 I chose out their way , and sat as chief . I lived as a king in the army , as one who comforts the mourners . 


$ 17:30:1 <" But now those who are younger than I have me in derision , whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs . 

$ 17:30:2 Of what use is the strength of their hands to me , men in whom ripe age has perished ? 

$ 17:30:3 They are gaunt from lack and famine . They gnaw the dry ground , in the gloom of waste and desolation . 

$ 17:30:4 They pluck salt herbs by the bushes . The roots of the broom are their food . 

$ 17:30:5 They are driven out from among men . They cry after them as after a thief ; 

$ 17:30:6 So that they dwell in frightful valleys , and in holes of the earth and of the rocks . 

$ 17:30:7 Among the bushes they bray ; and under the nettles they are gathered together . 

$ 17:30:8 They are children of fools , yes , children of wicked men . They were flogged out of the land . 

$ 17:30:9 <" Now I have become their song . Yes , I am a byword to them . 

$ 17:30:10 They abhor me , they stand aloof from me , and don't hesitate to spit in my face . 

$ 17:30:11 For he has untied his cord , and afflicted me ; and they have thrown off restraint before me . 

$ 17:30:12 On my right hand rise the rabble . They thrust aside my feet , They cast up against me their ways of destruction . 

$ 17:30:13 They mar my path , They set forward my calamity , without anyone's help . 

$ 17:30:14 As through a wide breach they come , in the middle of the ruin they roll themselves in . 

$ 17:30:15 Terrors have turned on me . They chase my honor as the wind . My welfare has passed away as a cloud . 

$ 17:30:16 <" Now my soul is poured out within me . Days of affliction have taken hold on me . 

$ 17:30:17 In the night season my bones are pierced in me , and the pains that gnaw me take no rest . 

$ 17:30:18 By great force is my garment disfigured . It binds me about as the collar of my tunic . 

$ 17:30:19 He has cast me into the mire . I have become like dust and ashes . 

$ 17:30:20 I cry to you , and you do not answer me . I stand up , and you gaze at me . 

$ 17:30:21 You have turned to be cruel to me . With the might of your hand you persecute me . 

$ 17:30:22 You lift me up to the wind , and drive me with it . You dissolve me in the storm . 

$ 17:30:23 For I know that you will bring me to death , To the house appointed for all living . 

$ 17:30:24 <" However doesn't one stretch out a hand in his fall ? Or in his calamity therefore cry for help ? 

$ 17:30:25 Didn't I weep for him who was in trouble ? Wasn't my soul grieved for the needy ? 

$ 17:30:26 When I looked for good , then evil came ; When I waited for light , there came darkness . 

$ 17:30:27 My heart is troubled , and doesn't rest . Days of affliction have come on me . 

$ 17:30:28 I go mourning without the sun . I stand up in the assembly , and cry for help . 

$ 17:30:29 I am a brother to jackals , and a companion to ostriches . 

$ 17:30:30 My skin grows black and peels from me . My bones are burned with heat . 

$ 17:30:31 Therefore my harp has turned to mourning , and my pipe into the voice of those who weep . 


$ 17:31:1 <" I made a covenant with my eyes , how then should I look lustfully at a young woman ? 

$ 17:31:2 For what is the portion from God above , and the heritage from the Almighty on high ? 

$ 17:31:3 Is it not calamity to the unrighteous , and disaster to the workers of iniquity ? 

$ 17:31:4 Doesn't he see my ways , and count all my steps ? 

$ 17:31:5 <" If I have walked with falsehood , and my foot has hurried to deceit 

$ 17:31:6 ( let me be weighed in an even balance , that God may know my integrity ) ; 

$ 17:31:7 if my step has turned out of the way , if my heart walked after my eyes , if any defilement has stuck to my hands , 

$ 17:31:8 then let me sow , and let another eat . Yes , let the produce of my field be rooted out . 

$ 17:31:9 <" If my heart has been enticed to a woman , and I have laid wait at my neighbor's door , 

$ 17:31:10 then let my wife grind for another , and let others sleep with her . 

$ 17:31:11 For that would be a heinous crime . Yes , it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges : 

$ 17:31:12 For it is a fire that consumes to destruction , and would root out all my increase . 

$ 17:31:13 <" If I have despised the cause of my male servant or of my female servant , when they contended with me ; 

$ 17:31:14 What then shall I do when God rises up ? When he visits , what shall I answer him ? 

$ 17:31:15 Didn't he who made me in the womb make him ? Didn't one fashion us in the womb ? 

$ 17:31:16 <" If I have withheld the poor from their desire , or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail , 

$ 17:31:17 or have eaten my morsel alone , and the fatherless has not eaten of it 

$ 17:31:18 ( no , from my youth he grew up with me as with a father , her I have guided from my mother's womb ) ; 

$ 17:31:19 if I have seen any perish for want of clothing , or that the needy had no covering ; 

$ 17:31:20 if his heart hasn't blessed me , if he hasn't been warmed with my sheep's fleece ; 

$ 17:31:21 if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless , because I saw my help in the gate , 

$ 17:31:22 then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade , and my arm be broken from the bone . 

$ 17:31:23 For calamity from God is a terror to me . Because his majesty , I can do nothing . 

$ 17:31:24 <" If I have made gold my hope , and have said to the fine gold , <' You are my confidence ; >' 

$ 17:31:25 If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great , and because my hand had gotten much ; 

$ 17:31:26 if I have seen the sun when it shined , or the moon moving in splendor , 

$ 17:31:27 and my heart has been secretly enticed , and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth , 

$ 17:31:28 this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges ; for I should have denied the God who is above . 

$ 17:31:29 <" If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me , or lifted up myself when evil found him 

$ 17:31:30 ( yes , I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse ) ; 

$ 17:31:31 if the men of my tent have not said , <' Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat ? >' 

$ 17:31:32 ( the foreigner has not camped in the street , but I have opened my doors to the traveler ) ; 

$ 17:31:33 if like Adam I have covered my transgressions , by hiding my iniquity in my heart , 

$ 17:31:34 because I feared the great multitude , and the contempt of families terrified me , so that I kept silence , and didn't go out of the door - 

$ 17:31:35 oh that I had one to hear me ! Behold , here is my signature ! Let the Almighty answer me ! Let the accuser write my indictment ! 

$ 17:31:36 Surely I would carry it on my shoulder ; and I would bind it to me as a crown . 

$ 17:31:37 I would declare to him the number of my steps . as a prince would I go near to him . 

$ 17:31:38 If my land cries out against me , and its furrows weep together ; 

$ 17:31:39 if I have eaten its fruits without money , or have caused its owners to lose their life , 

$ 17:31:40 let briers grow instead of wheat , and stinkweed instead of barley . >" The words of Job are ended . 


$ 17:32:1 So these three men ceased to answer Job , because he was righteous in his own eyes . 

$ 17:32:2 Then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel , the Buzite , of the family of Ram , was kindled against Job . His wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than God . 

$ 17:32:3 Also his wrath was kindled against his three friends , because they had found no answer , and yet had condemned Job . 

$ 17:32:4 Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job , because they were elder than he . 

$ 17:32:5 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men , his wrath was kindled . 

$ 17:32:6 Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered , <" I am young , and you are very old ; Therefore I held back , and didn't dare show you my opinion . 

$ 17:32:7 I said , <' Days should speak , and multitude of years should teach wisdom . >' 

$ 17:32:8 But there is a spirit in man , and the Spirit of the Almighty gives them understanding . 

$ 17:32:9 It is not the great who are wise , nor the aged who understand justice . 

$ 17:32:10 Therefore I said , <' Listen to me ; I also will show my opinion . >' 

$ 17:32:11 <" Behold , I waited for your words , and I listened for your reasoning , while you searched out what to say . 

$ 17:32:12 Yes , I gave you my full attention , but there was no one who convinced Job , or who answered his words , among you . 

$ 17:32:13 Beware lest you say , <' We have found wisdom , God may refute him , not man ; >' 

$ 17:32:14 for he has not directed his words against me ; neither will I answer him with your speeches . 

$ 17:32:15 <" They are amazed . They answer no more . They don't have a word to say . 

$ 17:32:16 Shall I wait , because they don't speak , because they stand still , and answer no more ? 

$ 17:32:17 I also will answer my part , and I also will show my opinion . 

$ 17:32:18 For I am full of words . The spirit within me constrains me . 

$ 17:32:19 Behold , my breast is as wine which has no vent ; like new wineskins it is ready to burst . 

$ 17:32:20 I will speak , that I may be refreshed . I will open my lips and answer . 

$ 17:32:21 Please don't let me respect any man's person , neither will I give flattering titles to any man . 

$ 17:32:22 For I don't know how to give flattering titles ; or else my Maker would soon take me away . 


$ 17:33:1 <" However , Job , please hear my speech , and listen to all my words . 

$ 17:33:2 See now , I have opened my mouth . My tongue has spoken in my mouth . 

$ 17:33:3 My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart . That which my lips know they shall speak sincerely . 

$ 17:33:4 The Spirit of God has made me , and the breath of the Almighty gives me life . 

$ 17:33:5 If you can , answer me . Set your words in order before me , and stand up . 

$ 17:33:6 Behold , I am toward God even as you are . I am also formed out of the clay . 

$ 17:33:7 Behold , my terror shall not make you afraid , neither shall my pressure be heavy on you . 

$ 17:33:8 <" Surely you have spoken in my hearing , I have heard the voice of your words , saying , 

$ 17:33:9 <' I am clean , without disobedience . I am innocent , neither is there iniquity in me . 

$ 17:33:10 Behold , he finds occasions against me . He counts me for his enemy . 

$ 17:33:11 He puts my feet in the stocks . He marks all my paths . >' 

$ 17:33:12 <" Behold , I will answer you . In this you are not just , for God is greater than man . 

$ 17:33:13 Why do you strive against him , because he doesn't give account of any of his matters ? 

$ 17:33:14 For God speaks once , yes twice , though man pays no attention . 

$ 17:33:15 In a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sleep falls on men , in slumbering on the bed ; 

$ 17:33:16 Then he opens the ears of men , and seals their instruction , 

$ 17:33:17 That he may withdraw man from his purpose , and hide pride from man . 

$ 17:33:18 He keeps back his soul from the pit , and his life from perishing by the sword . 

$ 17:33:19 He is chastened also with pain on his bed , with continual strife in his bones ; 

$ 17:33:20 So that his life abhors bread , and his soul dainty food . 

$ 17:33:21 His flesh is so consumed away , that it can't be seen . His bones that were not seen stick out . 

$ 17:33:22 Yes , his soul draws near to the pit , and his life to the destroyers . 

$ 17:33:23 <" If there is beside him an angel , an interpreter , one among a thousand , to show to man what is right for him ; 

$ 17:33:24 then God is gracious to him , and says , <' Deliver him from going down to the pit , I have found a ransom . >' 

$ 17:33:25 His flesh shall be fresher than a child's . He returns to the days of his youth . 

$ 17:33:26 He prays to God , and he is favorable to him , so that he sees his face with joy . He restores to man his righteousness . 

$ 17:33:27 He sings before men , and says , <' I have sinned , and perverted that which was right , and it didn't profit me . 

$ 17:33:28 He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit . My life shall see the light . >' 

$ 17:33:29 <" Behold , God does all these things , twice , yes three times , with a man , 

$ 17:33:30 to bring back his soul from the pit , that he may be enlightened with the light of the living . 

$ 17:33:31 Mark well , Job , and listen to me . Hold your peace , and I will speak . 

$ 17:33:32 If you have anything to say , answer me . Speak , for I desire to justify you . 

$ 17:33:33 If not , listen to me . Hold your peace , and I will teach you wisdom . >" 


$ 17:34:1 Moreover Elihu answered , 

$ 17:34:2 <" Hear my words , you wise men . Give ear to me , you who have knowledge . 

$ 17:34:3 For the ear tries words , as the palate tastes food . 

$ 17:34:4 Let us choose for us that which is right . Let us know among ourselves what is good . 

$ 17:34:5 For Job has said , <' I am righteous , God has taken away my right : 

$ 17:34:6 Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar . My wound is incurable , though I am without disobedience . >' 

$ 17:34:7 What man is like Job , who drinks scorn like water , 

$ 17:34:8 Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity , and walks with wicked men ? 

$ 17:34:9 For he has said , <' It profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with God . >' 

$ 17:34:10 <" Therefore listen to me , you men of understanding : far be it from God , that he should do wickedness , from the Almighty , that he should commit iniquity . 

$ 17:34:11 For the work of a man he will render to him , and cause every man to find according to his ways . 

$ 17:34:12 Yes surely , God will not do wickedly , neither will the Almighty pervert justice . 

$ 17:34:13 Who put him in charge of the earth ? or who has appointed him over the whole world ? 

$ 17:34:14 If he set his heart on himself , If he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath , 

$ 17:34:15 all flesh would perish together , and man would turn again to dust . 

$ 17:34:16 <" If now you have understanding , hear this . Listen to the voice of my words . 

$ 17:34:17 Shall even one who hates justice govern ? Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty ? - 

$ 17:34:18 Who says to a king , <' Vile ! >' or to nobles , <' Wicked ! >' ? 

$ 17:34:19 Who doesn't respect the persons of princes , nor respects the rich more than the poor ; for they all are the work of his hands . 

$ 17:34:20 In a moment they die , even at midnight . The people are shaken and pass away . The mighty are taken away without a hand . 

$ 17:34:21 <" For his eyes are on the ways of a man . He sees all his goings . 

$ 17:34:22 There is no darkness , nor thick gloom , where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves . 

$ 17:34:23 For he doesn't need to consider a man further , that he should go before God in judgment . 

$ 17:34:24 He breaks in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out , and sets others in their place . 

$ 17:34:25 Therefore he takes knowledge of their works . He overturns them in the night , so that they are destroyed . 

$ 17:34:26 He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others ; 

$ 17:34:27 because they turned away from following him , and wouldn't pay attention to any of his ways , 

$ 17:34:28 so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him . He heard the cry of the afflicted . 

$ 17:34:29 When he gives quietness , who then can condemn ? When he hides his face , who then can see him ? Alike whether to a nation , or to a man , 

$ 17:34:30 that the godless man may not reign , that there be no one to ensnare the people . 

$ 17:34:31 <" For has any said to God , <' I am guilty , but I will not offend any more . 

$ 17:34:32 Teach me that which I don't see . If I have done iniquity , I will do it no more >' ? 

$ 17:34:33 Shall his recompense be as you desire , that you refuse it ? For you must choose , and not I . Therefore speak what you know . 

$ 17:34:34 Men of understanding will tell me , yes , every wise man who hears me : 

$ 17:34:35 <' Job speaks without knowledge . His words are without wisdom . >' 

$ 17:34:36 I wish that Job were tried to the end , because of his answering like wicked men . 

$ 17:34:37 For he adds rebellion to his sin . He claps his hands among us , and multiplies his words against God . >" 


$ 17:35:1 Moreover Elihu answered , 

$ 17:35:2 <" Do you think this to be your right , or do you say , <' My righteousness is more than God's , >' 

$ 17:35:3 That you ask , <' What advantage will it be to you ? What profit shall I have , more than if I had sinned ? >' 

$ 17:35:4 I will answer you , and your companions with you . 

$ 17:35:5 Look to the heavens , and see . See the skies , which are higher than you . 

$ 17:35:6 If you have sinned , what effect do you have against him ? If your transgressions are multiplied , what do you do to him ? 

$ 17:35:7 If you are righteous , what do you give him ? Or what does he receive from your hand ? 

$ 17:35:8 Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are , and your righteousness may profit a son of man . 

$ 17:35:9 <" By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out . They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty . 

$ 17:35:10 But no one says , <' Where is God my Maker , who gives songs in the night , 

$ 17:35:11 who teaches us more than the animals of the earth , and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky ? >' 

$ 17:35:12 There they cry , but no one answers , because of the pride of evil men . 

$ 17:35:13 Surely God will not hear an empty cry , neither will the Almighty regard it . 

$ 17:35:14 How much less when you say you don't see him . The cause is before him , and you wait for him ! 

$ 17:35:15 But now , because he has not visited in his anger , neither does he greatly regard arrogance . 

$ 17:35:16 Therefore Job opens his mouth with empty talk , and he multiplies words without knowledge . >" 


$ 17:36:1 Elihu also continued , and said , 

$ 17:36:2 <" Bear with me a little , and I will show you ; for I still have something to say on God's behalf . 

$ 17:36:3 I will get my knowledge from afar , and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker . 

$ 17:36:4 For truly my words are not false . One who is perfect in knowledge is with you . 

$ 17:36:5 <" Behold , God is mighty , and doesn't despise anyone . He is mighty in strength of understanding . 

$ 17:36:6 He doesn't preserve the life of the wicked , but gives to the afflicted their right . 

$ 17:36:7 He doesn't withdraw his eyes from the righteous , but with kings on the throne , he sets them forever , and they are exalted . 

$ 17:36:8 If they are bound in fetters , and are taken in the cords of afflictions , 

$ 17:36:9 then he shows them their work , and their transgressions , that they have behaved themselves proudly . 

$ 17:36:10 He also opens their ears to instruction , and commands that they return from iniquity . 

$ 17:36:11 If they listen and serve him , they shall spend their days in prosperity , and their years in pleasures . 

$ 17:36:12 But if they don't listen , they shall perish by the sword ; they shall die without knowledge . 

$ 17:36:13 <" But those who are godless in heart lay up anger . They don't cry for help when he binds them . 

$ 17:36:14 They die in youth . Their life perishes among the unclean . 

$ 17:36:15 He delivers the afflicted by their affliction , and opens their ear in oppression . 

$ 17:36:16 Yes , he would have allured you out of distress , into a wide place , where there is no restriction . That which is set on your table would be full of fatness . 

$ 17:36:17 <" But you are full of the judgment of the wicked . Judgment and justice take hold of you . 

$ 17:36:18 Don't let riches entice you to wrath , neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside . 

$ 17:36:19 Would your wealth sustain you in distress , or all the might of your strength ? 

$ 17:36:20 Don't desire the night , when people are cut off in their place . 

$ 17:36:21 Take heed , don't regard iniquity ; for you have chosen this rather than affliction . 

$ 17:36:22 Behold , God is exalted in his power . Who is a teacher like him ? 

$ 17:36:23 Who has prescribed his way for him ? Or who can say , <' You have committed unrighteousness ? >' 

$ 17:36:24 <" Remember that you magnify his work , whereof men have sung . 

$ 17:36:25 All men have looked on it . Man sees it afar off . 

$ 17:36:26 Behold , God is great , and we don't know him . The number of his years is unsearchable . 

$ 17:36:27 For he draws up the drops of water , which distill in rain from his vapor , 

$ 17:36:28 Which the skies pour down and which drop on man abundantly . 

$ 17:36:29 Yes , can any understand the spreading of the clouds , and the thunderings of his pavilion ? 

$ 17:36:30 Behold , he spreads his light around him . He covers the bottom of the sea . 

$ 17:36:31 For by these he judges the people . He gives food in abundance . 

$ 17:36:32 He covers his hands with the lightning , and commands it to strike the mark . 

$ 17:36:33 Its noise tells about him , and the livestock also concerning the storm that comes up . 


$ 17:37:1 <" Yes , at this my heart trembles , and is moved out of its place . 

$ 17:37:2 Hear , oh , hear the noise of his voice , the sound that goes out of his mouth . 

$ 17:37:3 He sends it out under the whole sky , and his lightning to the ends of the earth . 

$ 17:37:4 After it a voice roars . He thunders with the voice of his majesty . He doesn't hold back anything when his voice is heard . 

$ 17:37:5 God thunders marvelously with his voice . He does great things , which we can't comprehend . 

$ 17:37:6 For he says to the snow , <' Fall on the earth ; >' likewise to the shower of rain , and to the showers of his mighty rain . 

$ 17:37:7 He seals up the hand of every man , that all men whom he has made may know it . 

$ 17:37:8 Then the animals take cover , and remain in their dens . 

$ 17:37:9 Out of its room comes the storm , and cold out of the north . 

$ 17:37:10 By the breath of God , ice is given , and the width of the waters is frozen . 

$ 17:37:11 Yes , he loads the thick cloud with moisture . He spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning . 

$ 17:37:12 It is turned around by his guidance , that they may do whatever he commands them on the surface of the habitable world , 

$ 17:37:13 Whether it is for correction , or for his land , or for loving kindness , that he causes it to come . 

$ 17:37:14 <" Listen to this , Job . Stand still , and consider the wondrous works of God . 

$ 17:37:15 Do you know how God controls them , and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine ? 

$ 17:37:16 Do you know the workings of the clouds , the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge ? 

$ 17:37:17 You whose clothing is warm , when the earth is still by reason of the south wind ? 

$ 17:37:18 Can you , with him , spread out the sky , which is strong as a cast metal mirror ? 

$ 17:37:19 Teach us what we shall tell him , for we can't make our case by reason of darkness . 

$ 17:37:20 Will it be told him that I would speak ? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up ? 

$ 17:37:21 Now men don't see the light which is bright in the skies , but the wind passes , and clears them . 

$ 17:37:22 Out of the north comes golden splendor . With God is awesome majesty . 

$ 17:37:23 We can't reach the Almighty . He is exalted in power . In justice and great righteousness , he will not oppress . 

$ 17:37:24 Therefore men revere him . He doesn't regard any who are wise of heart . >" 


$ 17:38:1 Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind , 

$ 17:38:2 <" Who is this who darkens counsel by words without knowledge ? 

$ 17:38:3 Brace yourself like a man , for I will question you , then you answer me ! 

$ 17:38:4 <" Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth ? Declare , if you have understanding . 

$ 17:38:5 Who determined its measures , if you know ? Or who stretched the line on it ? 

$ 17:38:6 Whereupon were its foundations fastened ? Or who laid its cornerstone , 

$ 17:38:7 when the morning stars sang together , and all the sons of God shouted for joy ? 

$ 17:38:8 <" Or who shut up the sea with doors , when it broke out of the womb , 

$ 17:38:9 when I made clouds its garment , and wrapped it in thick darkness , 

$ 17:38:10 marked out for it my bound , set bars and doors , 

$ 17:38:11 and said , <' Here you may come , but no further . Here your proud waves shall be stayed ? >' 

$ 17:38:12 <" Have you commanded the morning in your days , and caused the dawn to know its place ; 

$ 17:38:13 that it might take hold of the ends of the earth , and shake the wicked out of it ? 

$ 17:38:14 It is changed as clay under the seal , and presented as a garment . 

$ 17:38:15 From the wicked , their light is withheld . The high arm is broken . 

$ 17:38:16 <" Have you entered into the springs of the sea ? Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep ? 

$ 17:38:17 Have the gates of death been revealed to you ? Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death ? 

$ 17:38:18 Have you comprehended the earth in its width ? Declare , if you know it all . 

$ 17:38:19 <" What is the way to the dwelling of light ? As for darkness , where is its place , 

$ 17:38:20 that you should take it to its bound , that you should discern the paths to its house ? 

$ 17:38:21 Surely you know , for you were born then , and the number of your days is great ! 

$ 17:38:22 Have you entered the treasuries of the snow , or have you seen the treasures of the hail , 

$ 17:38:23 which I have reserved against the time of trouble , against the day of battle and war ? 

$ 17:38:24 By what way is the lightning distributed , or the east wind scattered on the earth ? 

$ 17:38:25 Who has cut a channel for the flood water , or the path for the thunderstorm ; 

$ 17:38:26 To cause it to rain on a land where no man is ; on the wilderness , in which there is no man ; 

$ 17:38:27 to satisfy the waste and desolate ground , to cause the tender grass to grow ? 

$ 17:38:28 Does the rain have a father ? Or who fathers the drops of dew ? 

$ 17:38:29 Out of whose womb came the ice ? The gray frost of the sky , who has given birth to it ? 

$ 17:38:30 The waters become hard like stone , when the surface of the deep is frozen . 

$ 17:38:31 <" Can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades , or loosen the cords of Orion ? 

$ 17:38:32 Can you lead the constellations out in their season ? Or can you guide the Bear with her cubs ? 

$ 17:38:33 Do you know the laws of the heavens ? Can you establish its dominion over the earth ? 

$ 17:38:34 <" Can you lift up your voice to the clouds , That abundance of waters may cover you ? 

$ 17:38:35 Can you send out lightnings , that they may go ? Do they report to you , <' Here we are ? >' 

$ 17:38:36 Who has put wisdom in the inward parts ? Or who has given understanding to the mind ? 

$ 17:38:37 Who can count the clouds by wisdom ? Or who can pour out the containers of the sky , 

$ 17:38:38 when the dust runs into a mass , and the clods of earth stick together ? 

$ 17:38:39 <" Can you hunt the prey for the lioness , or satisfy the appetite of the young lions , 

$ 17:38:40 when they crouch in their dens , and lie in wait in the thicket ? 

$ 17:38:41 Who provides for the raven his prey , when his young ones cry to God , and wander for lack of food ? 


$ 17:39:1 <" Do you know the time when the mountain goats give birth ? Do you watch when the doe bears fawns ? 

$ 17:39:2 Can you count the months that they fulfill ? Or do you know the time when they give birth ? 

$ 17:39:3 They bow themselves , they bear their young . They end their labor pains . 

$ 17:39:4 Their young ones become strong . They grow up in the open field . They go out , and don't return again . 

$ 17:39:5 <" Who has set the wild donkey free ? Or who has loosened the bonds of the swift donkey , 

$ 17:39:6 Whose home I have made the wilderness , and the salt land his dwelling place ? 

$ 17:39:7 He scorns the tumult of the city , neither does he hear the shouting of the driver . 

$ 17:39:8 The range of the mountains is his pasture , He searches after every green thing . 

$ 17:39:9 <" Will the wild ox be content to serve you ? Or will he stay by your feeding trough ? 

$ 17:39:10 Can you hold the wild ox in the furrow with his harness ? Or will he till the valleys after you ? 

$ 17:39:11 Will you trust him , because his strength is great ? Or will you leave to him your labor ? 

$ 17:39:12 Will you confide in him , that he will bring home your seed , and gather the grain of your threshing floor ? 

$ 17:39:13 <" The wings of the ostrich wave proudly ; but are they the feathers and plumage of love ? 

$ 17:39:14 For she leaves her eggs on the earth , warms them in the dust , 

$ 17:39:15 and forgets that the foot may crush them , or that the wild animal may trample them . 

$ 17:39:16 She deals harshly with her young ones , as if they were not hers . Though her labor is in vain , she is without fear , 

$ 17:39:17 because God has deprived her of wisdom , neither has he imparted to her understanding . 

$ 17:39:18 When she lifts up herself on high , she scorns the horse and his rider . 

$ 17:39:19 <" Have you given the horse might ? Have you clothed his neck with a quivering mane ? 

$ 17:39:20 Have you made him to leap as a locust ? The glory of his snorting is awesome . 

$ 17:39:21 He paws in the valley , and rejoices in his strength . He goes out to meet the armed men . 

$ 17:39:22 He mocks at fear , and is not dismayed , neither does he turn back from the sword . 

$ 17:39:23 The quiver rattles against him , the flashing spear and the javelin . 

$ 17:39:24 He eats up the ground with fierceness and rage , neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet . 

$ 17:39:25 As often as the trumpet sounds he snorts , <' Aha ! >' He smells the battle afar off , the thunder of the captains , and the shouting . 

$ 17:39:26 <" Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars , and stretches her wings toward the south ? 

$ 17:39:27 Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up , and makes his nest on high ? 

$ 17:39:28 On the cliff he dwells , and makes his home , on the point of the cliff , and the stronghold . 

$ 17:39:29 From there he spies out the prey . His eyes see it afar off . 

$ 17:39:30 His young ones also suck up blood . Where the slain are , there he is . >" 


$ 17:40:1 Moreover Yahweh answered Job , 

$ 17:40:2 <" Shall he who argues contend with the Almighty ? He who argues with God , let him answer it . >" 

$ 17:40:3 Then Job answered Yahweh , 

$ 17:40:4 <" Behold , I am of small account . What shall I answer you ? I lay my hand on my mouth . 

$ 17:40:5 I have spoken once , and I will not answer ; Yes , twice , but I will proceed no further . >" 

$ 17:40:6 Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind , 

$ 17:40:7 <" Now brace yourself like a man . I will question you , and you will answer me . 

$ 17:40:8 Will you even annul my judgment ? Will you condemn me , that you may be justified ? 

$ 17:40:9 Or do you have an arm like God ? Can you thunder with a voice like him ? 

$ 17:40:10 <" Now deck yourself with excellency and dignity . Array yourself with honor and majesty . 

$ 17:40:11 Pour out the fury of your anger . Look at everyone who is proud , and bring him low . 

$ 17:40:12 Look at everyone who is proud , and humble him . Crush the wicked in their place . 

$ 17:40:13 Hide them in the dust together . Bind their faces in the hidden place . 

$ 17:40:14 Then I will also admit to you that your own right hand can save you . 

$ 17:40:15 <" See now , behemoth , which I made as well as you . He eats grass as an ox . 

$ 17:40:16 Look now , his strength is in his thighs . His force is in the muscles of his belly . 

$ 17:40:17 He moves his tail like a cedar . The sinews of his thighs are knit together . 

$ 17:40:18 His bones are like tubes of bronze . His limbs are like bars of iron . 

$ 17:40:19 He is the chief of the ways of God . He who made him gives him his sword . 

$ 17:40:20 Surely the mountains produce food for him , where all the animals of the field play . 

$ 17:40:21 He lies under the lotus trees , in the covert of the reed , and the marsh . 

$ 17:40:22 The lotuses cover him with their shade . The willows of the brook surround him . 

$ 17:40:23 Behold , if a river overflows , he doesn't tremble . He is confident , though the Jordan swells even to his mouth . 

$ 17:40:24 Shall any take him when he is on the watch , or pierce through his nose with a snare ? 


$ 17:41:1 <" Can you draw out Leviathan with a fish hook , or press down his tongue with a cord ? 

$ 17:41:2 Can you put a rope into his nose , or pierce his jaw through with a hook ? 

$ 17:41:3 Will he make many petitions to you , or will he speak soft words to you ? 

$ 17:41:4 Will he make a covenant with you , that you should take him for a servant forever ? 

$ 17:41:5 Will you play with him as with a bird ? Or will you bind him for your girls ? 

$ 17:41:6 Will traders barter for him ? Will they part him among the merchants ? 

$ 17:41:7 Can you fill his skin with barbed irons , or his head with fish spears ? 

$ 17:41:8 Lay your hand on him . Remember the battle , and do so no more . 

$ 17:41:9 Behold , the hope of him is in vain . Won't one be cast down even at the sight of him ? 

$ 17:41:10 None is so fierce that he dare stir him up . Who then is he who can stand before me ? 

$ 17:41:11 Who has first given to me , that I should repay him ? Everything under the heavens is mine . 

$ 17:41:12 <" I will not keep silence concerning his limbs , nor his mighty strength , nor his goodly frame . 

$ 17:41:13 Who can strip off his outer garment ? Who shall come within his jaws ? 

$ 17:41:14 Who can open the doors of his face ? Around his teeth is terror . 

$ 17:41:15 Strong scales are his pride , shut up together with a close seal . 

$ 17:41:16 One is so near to another , that no air can come between them . 

$ 17:41:17 They are joined to one another . They stick together , so that they can't be pulled apart . 

$ 17:41:18 His sneezing flashes out light . His eyes are like the eyelids of the morning . 

$ 17:41:19 Out of his mouth go burning torches . Sparks of fire leap out . 

$ 17:41:20 Out of his nostrils a smoke goes , as of a boiling pot over a fire of reeds . 

$ 17:41:21 His breath kindles coals . A flame goes out of his mouth . 

$ 17:41:22 There is strength in his neck . Terror dances before him . 

$ 17:41:23 The flakes of his flesh are joined together . They are firm on him . They can't be moved . 

$ 17:41:24 His heart is as firm as a stone , yes , firm as the lower millstone . 

$ 17:41:25 When he raises himself up , the mighty are afraid . They retreat before his thrashing . 

$ 17:41:26 If one attacks him with the sword , it can't prevail ; nor the spear , the dart , nor the pointed shaft . 

$ 17:41:27 He counts iron as straw ; and bronze as rotten wood . 

$ 17:41:28 The arrow can't make him flee . Sling stones are like chaff to him . 

$ 17:41:29 Clubs are counted as stubble . He laughs at the rushing of the javelin . 

$ 17:41:30 His undersides are like sharp potsherds , leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge . 

$ 17:41:31 He makes the deep to boil like a pot . He makes the sea like a pot of ointment . 

$ 17:41:32 He makes a path shine after him . One would think the deep had white hair . 

$ 17:41:33 On earth there is not his equal , that is made without fear . 

$ 17:41:34 He sees everything that is high . He is king over all the sons of pride . >" 


$ 17:42:1 Then Job answered Yahweh , 

$ 17:42:2 <" I know that you can do all things , and that no purpose of yours can be restrained . 

$ 17:42:3 You asked , <' Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge ? >' therefore I have uttered that which I didn't understand , things too wonderful for me , which I didn't know . 

$ 17:42:4 You said , <' Listen , now , and I will speak ; I will question you , and you will answer me . >' 

$ 17:42:5 I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear , but now my eye sees you . 

$ 17:42:6 Therefore I abhor myself , and repent in dust and ashes . >" 

$ 17:42:7 It was so , that after Yahweh had spoken these words to Job , Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite , <" My wrath is kindled against you , and against your two friends ; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right , as my servant Job has . 

$ 17:42:8 Now therefore , take to yourselves seven bulls and seven rams , and go to my servant Job , and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering ; and my servant Job shall pray for you , for I will accept him , that I not deal with you according to your folly . For you have not spoken of me the thing that is right , as my servant Job has . >" 

$ 17:42:9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went , and did what Yahweh commanded them , and Yahweh accepted Job . 

$ 17:42:10 Yahweh turned the captivity of Job , when he prayed for his friends . Yahweh gave Job twice as much as he had before . 

$ 17:42:11 Then came there to him all his brothers , and all his sisters , and all those who had been of his acquaintance before , and ate bread with him in his house . They comforted him , and consoled him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on him . Everyone also gave him a piece of money , and everyone a ring of gold . 

$ 17:42:12 So Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning . He had fourteen thousand sheep , six thousand camels , one thousand yoke of oxen , and a thousand female donkeys . 

$ 17:42:13 He had also seven sons and three daughters . 

$ 17:42:14 He called the name of the first , Jemimah ; and the name of the second , Keziah ; and the name of the third , Keren Happuch . 

$ 17:42:15 In all the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job . Their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers . 

$ 17:42:16 After this Job lived one hundred forty years , and saw his sons , and his sons' sons , to four generations . 

$ 17:42:17 So Job died , being old and full of days .
