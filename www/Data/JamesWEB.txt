$ 19:1:1 James , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , to the twelve tribes which are in the Dispersion : Greetings . 

$ 19:1:2 Count it all joy , my brothers , when you fall into various temptations , 

$ 19:1:3 knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance . 

$ 19:1:4 Let endurance have its perfect work , that you may be perfect and complete , lacking in nothing . 

$ 19:1:5 But if any of you lacks wisdom , let him ask of God , who gives to all liberally and without reproach ; and it will be given to him . 

$ 19:1:6 But let him ask in faith , without any doubting , for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea , driven by the wind and tossed . 

$ 19:1:7 For that man shouldn't think that he will receive anything from the Lord . 

$ 19:1:8 He is a double - minded man , unstable in all his ways . 

$ 19:1:9 But let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position ; 

$ 19:1:10 and the rich , in that he is made humble , because like the flower in the grass , he will pass away . 

$ 19:1:11 For the sun arises with the scorching wind , and withers the grass , and the flower in it falls , and the beauty of its appearance perishes . So also will the rich man fade away in his pursuits . 

$ 19:1:12 Blessed is a person who endures temptation , for when he has been approved , he will receive the crown of life , which the Lord promised to those who love him . 

$ 19:1:13 Let no man say when he is tempted , <" I am tempted by God , >" for God can't be tempted by evil , and he himself tempts no one . 

$ 19:1:14 But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust , and enticed . 

$ 19:1:15 Then the lust , when it has conceived , bears sin ; and the sin , when it is full grown , produces death . 

$ 19:1:16 Don't be deceived , my beloved brothers . 

$ 19:1:17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , coming down from the Father of lights , with whom can be no variation , nor turning shadow . 

$ 19:1:18 Of his own will he gave birth to us by the word of truth , that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures . 

$ 19:1:19 So , then , my beloved brothers , let every man be swift to hear , slow to speak , and slow to anger ; 

$ 19:1:20 for the anger of man doesn't produce the righteousness of God . 

$ 19:1:21 Therefore , putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness , receive with humility the implanted word , which is able to save your souls . 

$ 19:1:22 But be doers of the word , and not only hearers , deluding your own selves . 

$ 19:1:23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror ; 

$ 19:1:24 for he sees himself , and goes away , and immediately forgets what kind of man he was . 

$ 19:1:25 But he who looks into the perfect law of freedom , and continues , not being a hearer who forgets , but a doer of the work , this man will be blessed in what he does . 

$ 19:1:26 If anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he doesn't bridle his tongue , but deceives his heart , this man's religion is worthless . 

$ 19:1:27 Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this : to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction , and to keep oneself unstained by the world . 


$ 19:2:1 My brothers , don't hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with partiality . 

$ 19:2:2 For if a man with a gold ring , in fine clothing , comes into your synagogue , and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in ; 

$ 19:2:3 and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing , and say , <" Sit here in a good place ; >" and you tell the poor man , <" Stand there , >" or <" Sit by my footstool ; >" 

$ 19:2:4 haven't you shown partiality among yourselves , and become judges with evil thoughts ? 

$ 19:2:5 Listen , my beloved brothers . Didn't God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith , and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him ? 

$ 19:2:6 But you have dishonored the poor man . Don't the rich oppress you , and personally drag you before the courts ? 

$ 19:2:7 Don't they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called ? 

$ 19:2:8 However , if you fulfill the royal law , according to the Scripture , <" You shall love your neighbor as yourself , >" you do well . 

$ 19:2:9 But if you show partiality , you commit sin , being convicted by the law as transgressors . 

$ 19:2:10 For whoever keeps the whole law , and yet stumbles in one point , he has become guilty of all . 

$ 19:2:11 For he who said , <" Do not commit adultery , >" also said , <" Do not commit murder . >" Now if you do not commit adultery , but murder , you have become a transgressor of the law . 

$ 19:2:12 So speak , and so do , as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom . 

$ 19:2:13 For judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy . Mercy triumphs over judgment . 

$ 19:2:14 What good is it , my brothers , if a man says he has faith , but has no works ? Can faith save him ? 

$ 19:2:15 And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food , 

$ 19:2:16 and one of you tells them , <" Go in peace , be warmed and filled ; >" and yet you didn't give them the things the body needs , what good is it ? 

$ 19:2:17 Even so faith , if it has no works , is dead in itself . 

$ 19:2:18 Yes , a man will say , <" You have faith , and I have works . >" Show me your faith without works , and I by my works will show you my faith . 

$ 19:2:19 You believe that God is one . You do well . The demons also believe , and shudder . 

$ 19:2:20 But do you want to know , vain man , that faith apart from works is dead ? 

$ 19:2:21 Wasn't Abraham our father justified by works , in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar ? 

$ 19:2:22 You see that faith worked with his works , and by works faith was perfected ; 

$ 19:2:23 and the Scripture was fulfilled which says , <" Abraham believed God , and it was accounted to him as righteousness ; >" and he was called the friend of God . 

$ 19:2:24 You see then that by works , a man is justified , and not only by faith . 

$ 19:2:25 In the same way , wasn't Rahab the prostitute also justified by works , in that she received the messengers , and sent them out another way ? 

$ 19:2:26 For as the body apart from the spirit is dead , even so faith apart from works is dead . 


$ 19:3:1 Let not many of you be teachers , my brothers , knowing that we will receive heavier judgment . 

$ 19:3:2 For in many things we all stumble . If anyone doesn't stumble in word , the same is a perfect man , able to bridle the whole body also . 

$ 19:3:3 Indeed , we put bits into the horses' mouths so that they may obey us , and we guide their whole body . 

$ 19:3:4 Behold , the ships also , though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds , are yet guided by a very small rudder , wherever the pilot desires . 

$ 19:3:5 So the tongue is also a little member , and boasts great things . See how a small fire can spread to a large forest ! 

$ 19:3:6 And the tongue is a fire . The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue , which defiles the whole body , and sets on fire the course of nature , and is set on fire by Gehenna . 

$ 19:3:7 For every kind of animal , bird , creeping thing , and sea creature , is tamed , and has been tamed by mankind ; 

$ 19:3:8 but nobody can tame the tongue . It is a restless evil , full of deadly poison . 

$ 19:3:9 With it we bless our God and Father , and with it we curse men , who are made in the image of God . 

$ 19:3:10 Out of the same mouth comes blessing and cursing . My brothers , these things ought not to be so . 

$ 19:3:11 Does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water ? 

$ 19:3:12 Can a fig tree , my brothers , yield olives , or a vine figs ? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water . 

$ 19:3:13 Who is wise and understanding among you ? Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom . 

$ 19:3:14 But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart , don't boast and don't lie against the truth . 

$ 19:3:15 This wisdom is not that which comes down from above , but is earthly , sensual , and demonic . 

$ 19:3:16 For where jealousy and selfish ambition are , there is confusion and every evil deed . 

$ 19:3:17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure , then peaceful , gentle , reasonable , full of mercy and good fruits , without partiality , and without hypocrisy . 

$ 19:3:18 Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace . 


$ 19:4:1 Where do wars and fightings among you come from ? Don't they come from your pleasures that war in your members ? 

$ 19:4:2 You lust , and don't have . You murder and covet , and can't obtain . You fight and make war . You don't have , because you don't ask . 

$ 19:4:3 You ask , and don't receive , because you ask with wrong motives , so that you may spend it on your pleasures . 

$ 19:4:4 You adulterers and adulteresses , don't you know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God ? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God . 

$ 19:4:5 Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain , <" The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously >" ? 

$ 19:4:6 But he gives more grace . Therefore it says , <" God resists the proud , but gives grace to the humble . >" 

$ 19:4:7 Be subject therefore to God . Resist the devil , and he will flee from you . 

$ 19:4:8 Draw near to God , and he will draw near to you . Cleanse your hands , you sinners ; and purify your hearts , you double - minded . 

$ 19:4:9 Lament , mourn , and weep . Let your laughter be turned to mourning , and your joy to gloom . 

$ 19:4:10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord , and he will exalt you . 

$ 19:4:11 Don't speak against one another , brothers . He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother , speaks against the law and judges the law . But if you judge the law , you are not a doer of the law , but a judge . 

$ 19:4:12 Only one is the lawgiver , who is able to save and to destroy . But who are you to judge another ? 

$ 19:4:13 Come now , you who say , <" Today or tomorrow let's go into this city , and spend a year there , trade , and make a profit . >" 

$ 19:4:14 Whereas you don't know what your life will be like tomorrow . For what is your life ? For you are a vapor that appears for a little time , and then vanishes away . 

$ 19:4:15 For you ought to say , <" If the Lord wills , we will both live , and do this or that . >" 

$ 19:4:16 But now you glory in your boasting . All such boasting is evil . 

$ 19:4:17 To him therefore who knows to do good , and doesn't do it , to him it is sin . 


$ 19:5:1 Come now , you rich , weep and howl for your miseries that are coming on you . 

$ 19:5:2 Your riches are corrupted and your garments are moth - eaten . 

$ 19:5:3 Your gold and your silver are corroded , and their corrosion will be for a testimony against you , and will eat your flesh like fire . You have laid up your treasure in the last days . 

$ 19:5:4 Behold , the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields , which you have kept back by fraud , cry out , and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Armies . 

$ 19:5:5 You have lived in luxury on the earth , and taken your pleasure . You have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter . 

$ 19:5:6 You have condemned , you have murdered the righteous one . He doesn't resist you . 

$ 19:5:7 Be patient therefore , brothers , until the coming of the Lord . Behold , the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth , being patient over it , until it receives the early and late rain . 

$ 19:5:8 You also be patient . Establish your hearts , for the coming of the Lord is at hand . 

$ 19:5:9 Don't grumble , brothers , against one another , so that you won't be judged . Behold , the judge stands at the door . 

$ 19:5:10 Take , brothers , for an example of suffering and of perseverance , the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord . 

$ 19:5:11 Behold , we call them blessed who endured . You have heard of the perseverance of Job , and have seen the Lord in the outcome , and how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy . 

$ 19:5:12 But above all things , my brothers , don't swear - not by heaven , or by the earth , or by any other oath ; but let your <" yes >" be <" yes >" , and your <" no >" , <" no >" ; so that you don't fall into hypocrisy . 

$ 19:5:13 Is any among you suffering ? Let him pray . Is any cheerful ? Let him sing praises . 

$ 19:5:14 Is any among you sick ? Let him call for the elders of the assembly , and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord , 

$ 19:5:15 and the prayer of faith will heal him who is sick , and the Lord will raise him up . If he has committed sins , he will be forgiven . 

$ 19:5:16 Confess your offenses to one another , and pray for one another , that you may be healed . The insistent prayer of a righteous person is powerfully effective . 

$ 19:5:17 Elijah was a man with a nature like ours , and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain , and it didn't rain on the earth for three years and six months . 

$ 19:5:18 He prayed again , and the sky gave rain , and the earth produced its fruit . 

$ 19:5:19 Brothers , if any among you wanders from the truth and someone turns him back , 

$ 19:5:20 let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins .
