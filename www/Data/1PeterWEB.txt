$ 20:1:1 Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ , to the chosen ones who are living as foreigners in the Dispersion in Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia , 

$ 20:1:2 according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , in sanctification of the Spirit , that you may obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood : Grace to you and peace be multiplied . 

$ 20:1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who according to his great mercy caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead , 

$ 20:1:4 to an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance that doesn't fade away , reserved in Heaven for you , 

$ 20:1:5 who by the power of God are guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time . 

$ 20:1:6 Wherein you greatly rejoice , though now for a little while , if need be , you have been put to grief in various trials , 

$ 20:1:7 that the proof of your faith , which is more precious than gold that perishes even though it is tested by fire , may be found to result in praise , glory , and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ - 

$ 20:1:8 whom not having known you love ; in whom , though now you don't see him , yet believing , you rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory - 

$ 20:1:9 receiving the result of your faith , the salvation of your souls . 

$ 20:1:10 Concerning this salvation , the prophets sought and searched diligently , who prophesied of the grace that would come to you , 

$ 20:1:11 searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ , which was in them , pointed to , when he predicted the sufferings of Christ , and the glories that would follow them . 

$ 20:1:12 To them it was revealed , that not to themselves , but to you , they ministered these things , which now have been announced to you through those who preached the Good News to you by the Holy Spirit sent out from heaven ; which things angels desire to look into . 

$ 20:1:13 Therefore prepare your minds for action , be sober , and set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ - 

$ 20:1:14 as children of obedience , not conforming yourselves according to your former lusts as in your ignorance , 

$ 20:1:15 but just as he who called you is holy , you yourselves also be holy in all of your behavior ; 

$ 20:1:16 because it is written , <" You shall be holy ; for I am holy . >" 

$ 20:1:17 If you call on him as Father , who without respect of persons judges according to each man's work , pass the time of your living as foreigners here in reverent fear : 

$ 20:1:18 knowing that you were redeemed , not with corruptible things , with silver or gold , from the useless way of life handed down from your fathers , 

$ 20:1:19 but with precious blood , as of a lamb without blemish or spot , the blood of Christ ; 

$ 20:1:20 who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world , but was revealed in this last age for your sake , 

$ 20:1:21 who through him are believers in God , who raised him from the dead , and gave him glory ; so that your faith and hope might be in God . 

$ 20:1:22 Seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth through the Spirit in sincere brotherly affection , love one another from the heart fervently : 

$ 20:1:23 having been born again , not of corruptible seed , but of incorruptible , through the word of God , which lives and remains forever . 

$ 20:1:24 For , <" All flesh is like grass , and all of man's glory like the flower in the grass . The grass withers , and its flower falls ; 

$ 20:1:25 but the Lord's word endures forever . >" This is the word of Good News which was preached to you . 


$ 20:2:1 Putting away therefore all wickedness , all deceit , hypocrisies , envies , and all evil speaking , 

$ 20:2:2 as newborn babies , long for the pure milk of the Word , that with it you may grow , 

$ 20:2:3 if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious : 

$ 20:2:4 coming to him , a living stone , rejected indeed by men , but chosen by God , precious . 

$ 20:2:5 You also , as living stones , are built up as a spiritual house , to be a holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God through Jesus Christ . 

$ 20:2:6 Because it is contained in Scripture , <" Behold , I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone , chosen , and precious : He who believes in him will not be disappointed . >" 

$ 20:2:7 For you who believe therefore is the honor , but for those who are disobedient , <" The stone which the builders rejected , has become the chief cornerstone , >" 

$ 20:2:8 and , <" a stone of stumbling , and a rock of offense . >" For they stumble at the word , being disobedient , to which also they were appointed . 

$ 20:2:9 But you are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people for God's own possession , that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light : 

$ 20:2:10 who in time past were no people , but now are God's people , who had not obtained mercy , but now have obtained mercy . 

$ 20:2:11 Beloved , I beg you as foreigners and pilgrims , to abstain from fleshly lusts , which war against the soul ; 

$ 20:2:12 having good behavior among the nations , so in that of which they speak against you as evildoers , they may by your good works , which they see , glorify God in the day of visitation . 

$ 20:2:13 Therefore subject yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake : whether to the king , as supreme ; 

$ 20:2:14 or to governors , as sent by him for vengeance on evildoers and for praise to those who do well . 

$ 20:2:15 For this is the will of God , that by well - doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men : 

$ 20:2:16 as free , and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness , but as bondservants of God . 

$ 20:2:17 Honor all men . Love the brotherhood . Fear God . Honor the king . 

$ 20:2:18 Servants , be in subjection to your masters with all fear ; not only to the good and gentle , but also to the wicked . 

$ 20:2:19 For it is commendable if someone endures pain , suffering unjustly , because of conscience toward God . 

$ 20:2:20 For what glory is it if , when you sin , you patiently endure beating ? But if , when you do well , you patiently endure suffering , this is commendable with God . 

$ 20:2:21 For to this you were called , because Christ also suffered for us , leaving you an example , that you should follow his steps , 

$ 20:2:22 who didn't sin , <" neither was deceit found in his mouth . >" 

$ 20:2:23 Who , when he was cursed , didn't curse back . When he suffered , didn't threaten , but committed himself to him who judges righteously . 

$ 20:2:24 He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree , that we , having died to sins , might live to righteousness ; by whose stripes you were healed . 

$ 20:2:25 For you were going astray like sheep ; but now have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls . 


$ 20:3:1 In the same way , wives , be in subjection to your own husbands ; so that , even if any don't obey the Word , they may be won by the behavior of their wives without a word ; 

$ 20:3:2 seeing your pure behavior in fear . 

$ 20:3:3 Let your beauty be not just the outward adorning of braiding the hair , and of wearing jewels of gold , or of putting on fine clothing ; 

$ 20:3:4 but in the hidden person of the heart , in the incorruptible adornment of a gentle and quiet spirit , which is in the sight of God very precious . 

$ 20:3:5 For this is how the holy women before , who hoped in God also adorned themselves , being in subjection to their own husbands : 

$ 20:3:6 as Sarah obeyed Abraham , calling him lord , whose children you now are , if you do well , and are not put in fear by any terror . 

$ 20:3:7 You husbands , in the same way , live with your wives according to knowledge , giving honor to the woman , as to the weaker vessel , as being also joint heirs of the grace of life ; that your prayers may not be hindered . 

$ 20:3:8 Finally , be all like - minded , compassionate , loving as brothers , tender hearted , courteous , 

$ 20:3:9 not rendering evil for evil , or insult for insult ; but instead blessing ; knowing that to this were you called , that you may inherit a blessing . 

$ 20:3:10 For , <" He who would love life , and see good days , let him keep his tongue from evil , and his lips from speaking deceit . 

$ 20:3:11 Let him turn away from evil , and do good . Let him seek peace , and pursue it . 

$ 20:3:12 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous , and his ears open to their prayer ; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil . >" 

$ 20:3:13 Now who is he who will harm you , if you become imitators of that which is good ? 

$ 20:3:14 But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake , you are blessed . <" Don't fear what they fear , neither be troubled . >" 

$ 20:3:15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts ; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you , with humility and fear : 

$ 20:3:16 having a good conscience ; that , while you are spoken against as evildoers , they may be disappointed who curse your good way of life in Christ . 

$ 20:3:17 For it is better , if it is God's will , that you suffer for doing well than for doing evil . 

$ 20:3:18 Because Christ also suffered for sins once , the righteous for the unrighteous , that he might bring you to God ; being put to death in the flesh , but made alive in the spirit ; 

$ 20:3:19 in which he also went and preached to the spirits in prison , 

$ 20:3:20 who before were disobedient , when God waited patiently in the days of Noah , while the ship was being built . In it , few , that is , eight souls , were saved through water . 

$ 20:3:21 This is a symbol of baptism , which now saves you - not the putting away of the filth of the flesh , but the answer of a good conscience toward God , through the resurrection of Jesus Christ , 

$ 20:3:22 who is at the right hand of God , having gone into heaven , angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him . 


$ 20:4:1 Therefore , since Christ suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves also with the same mind ; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin ; 

$ 20:4:2 that you no longer should live the rest of your time in the flesh for the lusts of men , but for the will of God . 

$ 20:4:3 For we have spent enough of our past time doing the desire of the Gentiles , and having walked in lewdness , lusts , drunken binges , orgies , carousings , and abominable idolatries . 

$ 20:4:4 They think it is strange that you don't run with them into the same excess of riot , blaspheming : 

$ 20:4:5 who will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead . 

$ 20:4:6 For to this end the Good News was preached even to the dead , that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh , but live as to God in the spirit . 

$ 20:4:7 But the end of all things is near . Therefore be of sound mind , self - controlled , and sober in prayer . 

$ 20:4:8 And above all things be earnest in your love among yourselves , for love covers a multitude of sins . 

$ 20:4:9 Be hospitable to one another without grumbling . 

$ 20:4:10 As each has received a gift , employ it in serving one another , as good managers of the grace of God in its various forms . 

$ 20:4:11 If anyone speaks , let it be as it were the very words of God . If anyone serves , let it be as of the strength which God supplies , that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ , to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever . Amen . 

$ 20:4:12 Beloved , don't be astonished at the fiery trial which has come upon you , to test you , as though a strange thing happened to you . 

$ 20:4:13 But because you are partakers of Christ's sufferings , rejoice ; that at the revelation of his glory you also may rejoice with exceeding joy . 

$ 20:4:14 If you are insulted for the name of Christ , you are blessed ; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you . On their part he is blasphemed , but on your part he is glorified . 

$ 20:4:15 For let none of you suffer as a murderer , or a thief , or an evil doer , or a meddler in other men's matters . 

$ 20:4:16 But if one of you suffers for being a Christian , let him not be ashamed ; but let him glorify God in this matter . 

$ 20:4:17 For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God . If it begins first with us , what will happen to those who don't obey the Good News of God ? 

$ 20:4:18 <" If it is hard for the righteous to be saved , what will happen to the ungodly and the sinner ? >" 

$ 20:4:19 Therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of God in doing good entrust their souls to him , as to a faithful Creator . 


$ 20:5:1 Therefore I exhort the elders among you , as a fellow elder , and a witness of the sufferings of Christ , and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed . 

$ 20:5:2 Shepherd the flock of God which is among you , exercising the oversight , not under compulsion , but voluntarily , not for dishonest gain , but willingly ; 

$ 20:5:3 neither as lording it over those entrusted to you , but making yourselves examples to the flock . 

$ 20:5:4 When the chief Shepherd is revealed , you will receive the crown of glory that doesn't fade away . 

$ 20:5:5 Likewise , you younger ones , be subject to the elder . Yes , all of you clothe yourselves with humility , to subject yourselves to one another ; for <" God resists the proud , but gives grace to the humble . >" 

$ 20:5:6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God , that he may exalt you in due time ; 

$ 20:5:7 casting all your worries on him , because he cares for you . 

$ 20:5:8 Be sober and self - controlled . Be watchful . Your adversary , the devil , walks around like a roaring lion , seeking whom he may devour . 

$ 20:5:9 Withstand him steadfast in your faith , knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings . 

$ 20:5:10 But may the God of all grace , who called you to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus , after you have suffered a little while , perfect , establish , strengthen , and settle you . 

$ 20:5:11 To him be the glory and the power forever and ever . Amen . 

$ 20:5:12 Through Silvanus , our faithful brother , as I consider him , I have written to you briefly , exhorting , and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand . 

$ 20:5:13 She who is in Babylon , chosen together with you , greets you ; and so does Mark , my son . 

$ 20:5:14 Greet one another with a kiss of love . Peace be to you all who are in Christ Jesus . Amen .
