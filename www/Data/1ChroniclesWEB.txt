$ 12:9:22 All these who were chosen to be gatekeepers in the thresholds were two hundred twelve . These were listed by genealogy in their villages , whom David and Samuel the seer ordained in their office of trust . 

$ 12:9:23 So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of Yahweh's house , even the house of the tent , by wards .

$ 12:9:25 Their brothers , in their villages , were to come in every seven days from time to time to be with them :

$ 12:9:33 These are the singers , heads of fathers' households of the Levites , who lived in the rooms and were free from other service ; for they were employed in their work day and night . 

$ 12:9:34 These were heads of fathers' households of the Levites , throughout their generations , chief men . These lived at Jerusalem .

$ 12:10:1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel , and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa . 

$ 12:10:2 The Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons ; and the Philistines killed Jonathan , Abinadab , and Malchishua , the sons of Saul . 

$ 12:10:3 The battle went hard against Saul , and the archers overtook him ; and he was distressed by reason of the archers . 

$ 12:10:4 Then Saul said to his armor bearer , <" Draw your sword , and thrust me through with it , lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me . >" But his armor bearer would not ; for he was terrified . Therefore Saul took his sword , and fell on it . 

$ 12:10:5 When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead , he likewise fell on his sword , and died . 

$ 12:10:6 So Saul died with his three sons ; and all his house died together . 

$ 12:10:7 When all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , they abandoned their cities , and fled ; and the Philistines came and lived in them . 

$ 12:10:8 On the next day , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa . 

$ 12:10:9 They stripped him , and took his head and his armor , and sent into the land of the Philistines all around , to carry the news to their idols , and to the people . 

$ 12:10:10 They put his armor in the house of their gods , and fastened his head in the house of Dagon . 

$ 12:10:11 When all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul , 

$ 12:10:12 all the valiant men arose , and took away the body of Saul , and the bodies of his sons , and brought them to Jabesh , and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh , and fasted seven days . 

$ 12:10:13 So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Yahweh , because of Yahweh's word , which he didn't keep ; and also because he asked counsel of one who had a familiar spirit , to inquire , 

$ 12:10:14 and didn't inquire of Yahweh . Therefore he killed him , and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse . 


$ 12:11:1 Then all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron , saying , <" Behold , we are your bone and your flesh . 

$ 12:11:2 In times past , even when Saul was king , it was you who led out and brought in Israel . Yahweh your God said to you , <' You shall be shepherd of my people Israel , and you shall be prince over my people Israel . >' >" 

$ 12:11:3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron ; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh ; and they anointed David king over Israel , according to Yahweh's word by Samuel . 

$ 12:11:4 David and all Israel went to Jerusalem ( also called Jebus ) ; and the Jebusites , the inhabitants of the land , were there . 

$ 12:11:5 The inhabitants of Jebus said to David , <" You will not come in here . >" Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion . The same is David's city . 

$ 12:11:6 David said , <" Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain . >" Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first , and was made chief . 

$ 12:11:7 David lived in the stronghold ; therefore they called it David's city . 

$ 12:11:8 He built the city all around , from Millo even around ; and Joab repaired the rest of the city . 

$ 12:11:9 David grew greater and greater ; for Yahweh of Armies was with him . 

$ 12:11:10 Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had , who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom , together with all Israel , to make him king , according to Yahweh's word concerning Israel . 

$ 12:11:11 This is the number of the mighty men whom David had : Jashobeam , the son of a Hachmonite , the chief of the thirty ; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time . 

$ 12:11:12 After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo , the Ahohite , who was one of the three mighty men . 

$ 12:11:13 He was with David at Pasdammim , and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle , where there was a plot of ground full of barley ; and the people fled from before the Philistines . 

$ 12:11:14 They stood in the middle of the plot , defended it , and killed the Philistines ; and Yahweh saved them by a great victory . 

$ 12:11:15 Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Adullam ; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim . 

$ 12:11:16 David was then in the stronghold , and the garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem at that time . 

$ 12:11:17 David longed , and said , <" Oh that one would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem , which is by the gate ! >" 

$ 12:11:18 The three broke through the army of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David ; but David would not drink any of it , but poured it out to Yahweh , 

$ 12:11:19 and said , <" My God forbid me , that I should do this ! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in jeopardy ? >" For they risked their lives to bring it . Therefore he would not drink it . The three mighty men did these things . 

$ 12:11:20 Abishai , the brother of Joab , he was chief of the three ; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three . 

$ 12:11:21 Of the three , he was more honorable than the two , and was made their captain ; however he wasn't included in the three . 

$ 12:11:22 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel , who had done mighty deeds , killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab . He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit on a snowy day . 

$ 12:11:23 He killed an Egyptian , a man of great stature , five cubits high . In the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam ; and he went down to him with a staff , plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand , and killed him with his own spear . 

$ 12:11:24 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things , and had a name among the three mighty men . 

$ 12:11:25 Behold , he was more honorable than the thirty , but he didn't attain to the three ; and David set him over his guard . 

$ 12:11:26 The mighty men of the armies also include Asahel the brother of Joab , Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem , 

$ 12:11:27 Shammoth the Harorite , Helez the Pelonite , 

$ 12:11:28 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite , Abiezer the Anathothite , 

$ 12:11:29 Sibbecai the Hushathite , Ilai the Ahohite , 

$ 12:11:30 Maharai the Netophathite , Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite , 

$ 12:11:31 Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin , Benaiah the Pirathonite , 

$ 12:11:32 Hurai of the brooks of Gaash , Abiel the Arbathite , 

$ 12:11:33 Azmaveth the Baharumite , Eliahba the Shaalbonite , 

$ 12:11:34 the sons of Hashem the Gizonite , Jonathan the son of Shagee the Hararite , 

$ 12:11:35 Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite , Eliphal the son of Ur , 

$ 12:11:36 Hepher the Mecherathite , Ahijah the Pelonite , 

$ 12:11:37 Hezro the Carmelite , Naarai the son of Ezbai , 

$ 12:11:38 Joel the brother of Nathan , Mibhar the son of Hagri , 

$ 12:11:39 Zelek the Ammonite , Naharai the Berothite , the armor bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah , 

$ 12:11:40 Ira the Ithrite , Gareb the Ithrite , 

$ 12:11:41 Uriah the Hittite , Zabad the son of Ahlai , 

$ 12:11:42 Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite , a chief of the Reubenites , and thirty with him , 

$ 12:11:43 Hanan the son of Maacah , and Joshaphat the Mithnite , 

$ 12:11:44 Uzzia the Ashterathite , Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite , 

$ 12:11:45 Jediael the son of Shimri , and Joha his brother , the Tizite , 

$ 12:11:46 Eliel the Mahavite , and Jeribai , and Joshaviah , the sons of Elnaam , and Ithmah the Moabite , 

$ 12:11:47 Eliel , and Obed , and Jaasiel the Mezobaite . 


$ 12:12:1 Now these are those who came to David to Ziklag , while he was a fugitive from Saul the son of Kish . They were among the mighty men , his helpers in war . 

$ 12:12:2 They were armed with bows , and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow . They were of Saul's relatives of the tribe of Benjamin . 

$ 12:12:3 The chief was Ahiezer , then Joash , the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite ; Jeziel and Pelet , the sons of Azmaveth ; Beracah ; Jehu the Anathothite ; 

$ 12:12:4 Ishmaiah the Gibeonite , a mighty man among the thirty and a leader of the thirty ; Jeremiah ; Jahaziel ; Johanan ; Jozabad the Gederathite ; 

$ 12:12:5 Eluzai ; Jerimoth ; Bealiah ; Shemariah ; Shephatiah the Haruphite ; 

$ 12:12:6 Elkanah , Isshiah Azarel , Joezer , and Jashobeam , the Korahites ; 

$ 12:12:7 and Joelah and Zebadiah , the sons of Jeroham of Gedor . 

$ 12:12:8 Some Gadites joined David in the stronghold in the wilderness , mighty men of valor , men trained for war , who could handle shield and spear ; whose faces were like the faces of lions , and they were as swift as the gazelles on the mountains : 

$ 12:12:9 Ezer the chief , Obadiah the second , Eliab the third , 

$ 12:12:10 Mishmannah the fourth , Jeremiah the fifth , 

$ 12:12:11 Attai the sixth , Eliel the seventh , 

$ 12:12:12 Johanan the eighth , Elzabad the ninth , 

$ 12:12:13 Jeremiah the tenth , and Machbannai the eleventh . 

$ 12:12:14 These of the sons of Gad were captains of the army : he who was least was equal to one hundred , and the greatest to one thousand . 

$ 12:12:15 These are those who went over the Jordan in the first month , when it had overflowed all its banks ; and they put to flight all who lived in the valleys , both toward the east and toward the west . 

$ 12:12:16 Some of the children of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David . 

$ 12:12:17 David went out to meet them , and answered them , <" If you have come peaceably to me to help me , my heart will be united with you ; but if you have come to betray me to my adversaries , since there is no wrong in my hands , may the God of our fathers see this and rebuke it . >" 

$ 12:12:18 Then the Spirit came on Amasai , who was chief of the thirty , and he said , <" We are yours , David , and on your side , you son of Jesse . Peace , peace be to you , and peace be to your helpers ; for your God helps you . >" Then David received them , and made them captains of the band . 

$ 12:12:19 Some of Manasseh also joined David , when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle ; but they didn't help them ; for the lords of the Philistines sent him away after consultation , saying , <" He will desert to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads . >" 

$ 12:12:20 As he went to Ziklag , some from Manasseh joined him : Adnah , Jozabad , Jediael , Michael , Jozabad , Elihu , and Zillethai , captains of thousands who were of Manasseh . 

$ 12:12:21 They helped David against the band of rovers ; for they were all mighty men of valor , and were captains in the army . 

$ 12:12:22 For from day to day men came to David to help him , until there was a great army , like God's army . 

$ 12:12:23 These are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war , who came to David to Hebron , to turn the kingdom of Saul to him , according to Yahweh's word . 

$ 12:12:24 The children of Judah who bore shield and spear were six thousand eight hundred , armed for war . 

$ 12:12:25 Of the children of Simeon , mighty men of valor for the war , seven thousand one hundred . 

$ 12:12:26 Of the children of Levi four thousand six hundred . 

$ 12:12:27 Jehoiada was the leader of the household of Aaron ; and with him were three thousand seven hundred , 

$ 12:12:28 and Zadok , a young man mighty of valor , and of his father's house twenty - two captains . 

$ 12:12:29 Of the children of Benjamin , Saul's relatives , three thousand : for until then , the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to Saul's house . 

$ 12:12:30 Of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred , mighty men of valor , famous men in their fathers' houses . 

$ 12:12:31 Of the half - tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand , who were mentioned by name , to come and make David king . 

$ 12:12:32 Of the children of Issachar , men who had understanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do , their heads were two hundred ; and all their brothers were at their command . 

$ 12:12:33 Of Zebulun , such as were able to go out in the army , who could set the battle in array , with all kinds of instruments of war , fifty thousand , and who could command and were not of double heart . 

$ 12:12:34 Of Naphtali one thousand captains , and with them with shield and spear thirty - seven thousand . 

$ 12:12:35 Of the Danites who could set the battle in array , twenty - eight thousand six hundred . 

$ 12:12:36 Of Asher , such as were able to go out in the army , who could set the battle in array , forty thousand . 

$ 12:12:37 On the other side of the Jordan , of the Reubenites , the Gadites , and of the half - tribe of Manasseh , with all kinds of instruments of war for the battle , one hundred twenty thousand . 

$ 12:12:38 All these were men of war , who could order the battle array , and came with a perfect heart to Hebron , to make David king over all Israel ; and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king . 

$ 12:12:39 They were there with David three days , eating and drinking ; for their brothers had supplied provisions for them . 

$ 12:12:40 Moreover those who were near to them , as far as Issachar , Zebulun , and Naphtali , brought bread on donkeys , on camels , on mules , and on oxen : supplies of flour , cakes of figs , clusters of raisins , wine , oil , cattle , and sheep in abundance ; for there was joy in Israel . 


$ 12:13:1 David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds , even with every leader . 

$ 12:13:2 David said to all the assembly of Israel , <" If it seems good to you , and if it is of Yahweh our God , let's send word everywhere to our brothers who are left in all the land of Israel , with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that have pasture lands , that they may gather themselves to us . 

$ 12:13:3 Also , let's bring the ark of our God back to us again ; for we didn't seek it in the days of Saul . >" 

$ 12:13:4 All the assembly said that they would do so ; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people . 

$ 12:13:5 So David assembled all Israel together , from the Shihor the brook of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath , to bring God's ark from Kiriath Jearim . 

$ 12:13:6 David went up with all Israel to Baalah , that is , to Kiriath Jearim , which belonged to Judah , to bring up from there God Yahweh's ark that sits above the cherubim , that is called by the Name . 

$ 12:13:7 They carried God's ark on a new cart , and brought it out of Abinadab's house ; and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart . 

$ 12:13:8 David and all Israel played before God with all their might , even with songs , with harps , with stringed instruments , with tambourines , with cymbals , and with trumpets . 

$ 12:13:9 When they came to Chidon's threshing floor , Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark ; for the oxen stumbled . 

$ 12:13:10 Yahweh's anger burned against Uzza , and he struck him , because he put his hand on the ark ; and he died there before God . 

$ 12:13:11 David was displeased , because Yahweh had broken out against Uzza . He called that place Perez Uzza , to this day . 

$ 12:13:12 David was afraid of God that day , saying , <" How can I bring God's ark home to me ? >" 

$ 12:13:13 So David didn't move the ark with him into David's city , but carried it aside into Obed - Edom the Gittite's house . 

$ 12:13:14 God's ark remained with the family of Obed - Edom in his house three months ; and Yahweh blessed Obed - Edom's house and all that he had . 


$ 12:14:1 Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees , masons , and carpenters , to build him a house . 

$ 12:14:2 David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel ; for his kingdom was exalted on high , for his people Israel's sake . 

$ 12:14:3 David took more wives at Jerusalem , and David became the father of more sons and daughters . 

$ 12:14:4 These are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem : Shammua , Shobab , Nathan , Solomon , 

$ 12:14:5 Ibhar , Elishua , Elpelet , 

$ 12:14:6 Nogah , Nepheg , Japhia , 

$ 12:14:7 Elishama , Beeliada , and Eliphelet . 

$ 12:14:8 When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel , all the Philistines went up to seek David ; and David heard of it , and went out against them . 

$ 12:14:9 Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim . 

$ 12:14:10 David inquired of God , saying , <" Shall I go up against the Philistines ? Will you deliver them into my hand ? >" Yahweh said to him , <" Go up ; for I will deliver them into your hand . >" 

$ 12:14:11 So they came up to Baal Perazim , and David defeated them there . David said , God has broken my enemies by my hand , like waters breaking out . Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim . 

$ 12:14:12 They left their gods there ; and David gave a command , and they were burned with fire . 

$ 12:14:13 The Philistines made a another raid in the valley . 

$ 12:14:14 David inquired again of God ; and God said to him , <" You shall not go up after them . Turn away from them , and come on them opposite the mulberry trees . 

$ 12:14:15 When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees , then go out to battle ; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines . >" 

$ 12:14:16 David did as God commanded him ; and they attacked the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer . 

$ 12:14:17 The fame of David went out into all lands ; and Yahweh brought the fear of him on all nations . 


$ 12:15:1 David made himself houses in David's city ; and he prepared a place for God's ark , and pitched a tent for it . 

$ 12:15:2 Then David said , <" No one ought to carry God's ark but the Levites . For Yahweh has chosen them to carry God's ark , and to minister to him forever . >" 

$ 12:15:3 David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem , to bring up Yahweh's ark to its place , which he had prepared for it . 

$ 12:15:4 David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites : 

$ 12:15:5 of the sons of Kohath , Uriel the chief , and his brothers one hundred twenty ; 

$ 12:15:6 of the sons of Merari , Asaiah the chief , and his brothers two hundred twenty ; 

$ 12:15:7 of the sons of Gershom , Joel the chief , and his brothers one hundred thirty ; 

$ 12:15:8 of the sons of Elizaphan , Shemaiah the chief , and his brothers two hundred ; 

$ 12:15:9 of the sons of Hebron , Eliel the chief , and his brothers eighty ; 

$ 12:15:10 of the sons of Uzziel , Amminadab the chief , and his brothers one hundred twelve . 

$ 12:15:11 David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests , and for the Levites , for Uriel , Asaiah , Joel , Shemaiah , Eliel , and Amminadab , 

$ 12:15:12 and said to them , <" You are the heads of the fathers' households of the Levites . Sanctify yourselves , both you and your brothers , that you may bring the ark of Yahweh , the God of Israel , up to the place that I have prepared for it . 

$ 12:15:13 For because you didn't carry it at first , Yahweh our God broke out in anger against us , because we didn't seek him according to the ordinance . >" 

$ 12:15:14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh , the God of Israel . 

$ 12:15:15 The children of the Levites bore God's ark on their shoulders with its poles , as Moses commanded according to Yahweh's word . 

$ 12:15:16 David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers as singers with instruments of music , stringed instruments , harps , and cymbals , sounding aloud and lifting up their voices with joy . 

$ 12:15:17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel ; and of his brothers , Asaph the son of Berechiah ; and of the sons of Merari their brothers , Ethan the son of Kushaiah ; 

$ 12:15:18 and with them their brothers of the second rank , Zechariah , Ben , Jaaziel , Shemiramoth , Jehiel , Unni , Eliab , Benaiah , Maaseiah , Mattithiah , Eliphelehu , Mikneiah , Obed - Edom , and Jeiel , the doorkeepers . 

$ 12:15:19 So the singers , Heman , Asaph , and Ethan , were given cymbals of bronze to sound aloud ; 

$ 12:15:20 and Zechariah , Aziel , Shemiramoth , Jehiel , Unni , Eliab , Maaseiah , and Benaiah , with stringed instruments set to Alamoth ; 

$ 12:15:21 and Mattithiah , Eliphelehu , Mikneiah , Obed - Edom , Jeiel , and Azaziah , with harps tuned to the eight - stringed lyre , to lead . 

$ 12:15:22 Chenaniah , chief of the Levites , was over the singing . He taught the singers , because he was skillful . 

$ 12:15:23 Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark . 

$ 12:15:24 Shebaniah , Joshaphat , Nethanel , Amasai , Zechariah , Benaiah , and Eliezer , the priests , blew the trumpets before God's ark ; and Obed - Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark . 

$ 12:15:25 So David , the elders of Israel , and the captains over thousands , went to bring the ark of Yahweh's covenant up out of the house of Obed - Edom with joy . 

$ 12:15:26 When God helped the Levites who bore the ark of Yahweh's covenant , they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams . 

$ 12:15:27 David was clothed with a robe of fine linen , as were all the Levites who bore the ark , the singers , and Chenaniah the choir master with the singers ; and David had an ephod of linen on him . 

$ 12:15:28 Thus all Israel brought the ark of Yahweh's covenant up with shouting , with sound of the cornet , with trumpets , and with cymbals , sounding aloud with stringed instruments and harps . 

$ 12:15:29 As the ark of Yahweh's covenant came to David's city , Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window , and saw king David dancing and playing ; and she despised him in her heart . 


$ 12:16:1 They brought in God's ark , and set it in the middle of the tent that David had pitched for it ; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God . 

$ 12:16:2 When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings , he blessed the people in Yahweh's name . 

$ 12:16:3 He gave to everyone of Israel , both man and woman , to everyone a loaf of bread , a portion of meat , and a cake of raisins . 

$ 12:16:4 He appointed some of the Levites to minister before Yahweh's ark , and to commemorate , to thank , and to praise Yahweh , the God of Israel : 

$ 12:16:5 Asaph the chief , and second to him Zechariah , then Jeiel , Shemiramoth , Jehiel , Mattithiah , Eliab , Benaiah , Obed - Edom , and Jeiel , with stringed instruments and with harps ; and Asaph with cymbals , sounding aloud ; 

$ 12:16:6 with Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually , before the ark of the covenant of God . 

$ 12:16:7 Then on that day David first ordained to give thanks to Yahweh , by the hand of Asaph and his brothers . 

$ 12:16:8 Oh give thanks to Yahweh . Call on his name . Make what he has done known among the peoples . 

$ 12:16:9 Sing to him . Sing praises to him . Tell of all his marvelous works . 

$ 12:16:10 Glory in his holy name . Let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice . 

$ 12:16:11 Seek Yahweh and his strength . Seek his face forever more . 

$ 12:16:12 Remember his marvelous works that he has done , his wonders , and the judgments of his mouth , 

$ 12:16:13 you offspring of Israel his servant , you children of Jacob , his chosen ones . 

$ 12:16:14 He is Yahweh our God . His judgments are in all the earth . 

$ 12:16:15 Remember his covenant forever , the word which he commanded to a thousand generations , 

$ 12:16:16 the covenant which he made with Abraham , his oath to Isaac . 

$ 12:16:17 He confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute , and to Israel for an everlasting covenant , 

$ 12:16:18 saying , <" I will give you the land of Canaan , The lot of your inheritance , >" 

$ 12:16:19 when you were but a few men in number , yes , very few , and foreigners were in it . 

$ 12:16:20 They went about from nation to nation , from one kingdom to another people . 

$ 12:16:21 He allowed no man to do them wrong . Yes , he reproved kings for their sakes , 

$ 12:16:22 <" Don't touch my anointed ones ! Do my prophets no harm ! >" 

$ 12:16:23 Sing to Yahweh , all the earth ! Display his salvation from day to day . 

$ 12:16:24 Declare his glory among the nations , and his marvelous works among all the peoples . 

$ 12:16:25 For great is Yahweh , and greatly to be praised . He also is to be feared above all gods . 

$ 12:16:26 For all the gods of the peoples are idols , but Yahweh made the heavens . 

$ 12:16:27 Honor and majesty are before him . Strength and gladness are in his place . 

$ 12:16:28 Ascribe to Yahweh , you relatives of the peoples , ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength ! 

$ 12:16:29 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name . Bring an offering , and come before him . Worship Yahweh in holy array . 

$ 12:16:30 Tremble before him , all the earth . The world also is established that it can't be moved . 

$ 12:16:31 Let the heavens be glad , and let the earth rejoice ! Let them say among the nations , <" Yahweh reigns ! >" 

$ 12:16:32 Let the sea roar , and its fullness ! Let the field exult , and all that is in it ! 

$ 12:16:33 Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before Yahweh , for he comes to judge the earth . 

$ 12:16:34 Oh give thanks to Yahweh , for he is good , for his loving kindness endures forever . 

$ 12:16:35 Say , <" Save us , God of our salvation ! Gather us together and deliver us from the nations , to give thanks to your holy name , to triumph in your praise . >" 

$ 12:16:36 Blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , from everlasting even to everlasting . All the people said , <" Amen , >" and praised Yahweh . 

$ 12:16:37 So he left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of Yahweh's covenant , to minister before the ark continually , as every day's work required ; 

$ 12:16:38 and Obed - Edom with their brothers , sixty - eight ; Obed - Edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers ; 

$ 12:16:39 and Zadok the priest , and his brothers the priests , before Yahweh's tabernacle in the high place that was at Gibeon , 

$ 12:16:40 to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening , even according to all that is written in Yahweh's law , which he commanded to Israel ; 

$ 12:16:41 and with them Heman and Jeduthun , and the rest who were chosen , who were mentioned by name , to give thanks to Yahweh , because his loving kindness endures forever ; 

$ 12:16:42 and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud , and with instruments for the songs of God ; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate . 

$ 12:16:43 All the people departed , each man to his house ; and David returned to bless his house . 


$ 12:17:1 When David lived in his house , David said to Nathan the prophet , <" Behold , I dwell in a house of cedar , but the ark of Yahweh's covenant is in a tent . >" 

$ 12:17:2 Nathan said to David , <" Do all that is in your heart ; for God is with you . >" 

$ 12:17:3 That same night , the word of God came to Nathan , saying , 

$ 12:17:4 <" Go and tell David my servant , <' Yahweh says , <" You shall not build me a house to dwell in ; 

$ 12:17:5 for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day , but have gone from tent to tent , and from one tent to another . 

$ 12:17:6 In all places in which I have walked with all Israel , did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel , whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people , saying , <' Why have you not built me a house of cedar ? >' >" >' 

$ 12:17:7 <" Now therefore , you shall tell my servant David , <' Yahweh of Armies says , <" I took you from the sheep pen , from following the sheep , to be prince over my people Israel . 

$ 12:17:8 I have been with you wherever you have gone , and have cut off all your enemies from before you . I will make you a name , like the name of the great ones who are in the earth . 

$ 12:17:9 I will appoint a place for my people Israel , and will plant them , that they may dwell in their own place , and be moved no more . The children of wickedness will not waste them any more , as at the first , 

$ 12:17:10 and from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel . I will subdue all your enemies . Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house . 

$ 12:17:11 It will happen , when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers , that I will set up your offspring after you , who will be of your sons ; and I will establish his kingdom . 

$ 12:17:12 He will build me a house , and I will establish his throne forever . 

$ 12:17:13 I will be his father , and he will be my son . I will not take my loving kindness away from him , as I took it from him that was before you ; 

$ 12:17:14 but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever . His throne will be established forever . >" >' >" 

$ 12:17:15 According to all these words , and according to all this vision , so Nathan spoke to David . 

$ 12:17:16 Then David the king went in , and sat before Yahweh ; and he said , <" Who am I , Yahweh God , and what is my house , that you have brought me this far ? 

$ 12:17:17 This was a small thing in your eyes , God ; but you have spoken of your servant's house for a great while to come , and have respected me according to the standard of a man of high degree , Yahweh God . 

$ 12:17:18 What can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant ? For you know your servant . 

$ 12:17:19 Yahweh , for your servant's sake , and according to your own heart , you have done all this greatness , to make known all these great things . 

$ 12:17:20 Yahweh , there is no one like you , neither is there any God besides you , according to all that we have heard with our ears . 

$ 12:17:21 What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel , whom God went to redeem to himself for a people , to make you a name by great and awesome things , in driving out nations from before your people , whom you redeem out of Egypt ? 

$ 12:17:22 For you made your people Israel your own people forever ; and you , Yahweh , became their God . 

$ 12:17:23 Now , Yahweh , let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant , and concerning his house , be established forever , and do as you have spoken . 

$ 12:17:24 Let your name be established and magnified forever , saying , <' Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel , even a God to Israel . The house of David your servant is established before you . >' 

$ 12:17:25 For you , my God , have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house . Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you . 

$ 12:17:26 Now , Yahweh , you are God , and have promised this good thing to your servant . 

$ 12:17:27 Now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant , that it may continue forever before you ; for you , Yahweh , have blessed , and it is blessed forever . >" 


$ 12:18:1 After this , David defeated the Philistines and subdued them , and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines . 

$ 12:18:2 He defeated Moab ; and the Moabites became servants to David , and brought tribute . 

$ 12:18:3 David defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah to Hamath , as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates . 

$ 12:18:4 David took from him one thousand chariots , seven thousand horsemen , and twenty thousand footmen ; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses , but reserved of them enough for one hundred chariots . 

$ 12:18:5 When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah , David struck twenty - two thousand men of the Syrians . 

$ 12:18:6 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus ; and the Syrians became servants to David , and brought tribute . Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went . 

$ 12:18:7 David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer , and brought them to Jerusalem . 

$ 12:18:8 From Tibhath and from Cun , cities of Hadadezer , David took very much bronze , with which Solomon made the bronze sea , the pillars , and the vessels of bronze . 

$ 12:18:9 When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah , 

$ 12:18:10 he sent Hadoram his son to king David , to Greet him , and to bless him , because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him ( for Hadadezer had wars with Tou ) ; and he had with him all kinds of vessels of gold and silver and bronze . 

$ 12:18:11 King David also dedicated these to Yahweh , with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations ; from Edom , from Moab , from the children of Ammon , from the Philistines , and from Amalek . 

$ 12:18:12 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck eighteen thousand of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt . 

$ 12:18:13 He put garrisons in Edom ; and all the Edomites became servants to David . Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went . 

$ 12:18:14 David reigned over all Israel ; and he executed justice and righteousness for all his people . 

$ 12:18:15 Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army ; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder ; 

$ 12:18:16 Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Abimelech the son of Abiathar , were priests ; Shavsha was scribe ; 

$ 12:18:17 and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites ; and the sons of David were chief officials serving the king . 


$ 12:19:1 After this , Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died , and his son reigned in his place . 

$ 12:19:2 David said , <" I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash , because his father showed kindness to me . >" So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father . David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun , to comfort him . 

$ 12:19:3 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun , <" Do you think that David honors your father , in that he has sent comforters to you ? Haven't his servants come to you to search , to overthrow , and to spy out the land ? >" 

$ 12:19:4 So Hanun took David's servants , shaved them , and cut off their garments in the middle at their buttocks , and sent them away . 

$ 12:19:5 Then some people went and told David how the men were treated . He sent to meet them ; for the men were greatly humiliated . The king said , <" Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown , and then return . >" 

$ 12:19:6 When the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David , Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia , out of Aram - maacah , and out of Zobah . 

$ 12:19:7 So they hired for themselves thirty - two thousand chariots , and the king of Maacah with his people , who came and encamped near Medeba . The children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities , and came to battle . 

$ 12:19:8 When David heard of it , he sent Joab with all the army of the mighty men . 

$ 12:19:9 The children of Ammon came out , and put the battle in array at the gate of the city ; and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field . 

$ 12:19:10 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose some of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians . 

$ 12:19:11 The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother ; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon . 

$ 12:19:12 He said , <" If the Syrians are too strong for me , then you are to help me ; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you , then I will help you . 

$ 12:19:13 Be courageous , and let's be strong for our people and for the cities of our God . May Yahweh do that which seems good to him . >" 

$ 12:19:14 So Joab and the people who were with him came near to the front of the Syrians to the battle ; and they fled before him . 

$ 12:19:15 When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled , they likewise fled before Abishai his brother , and entered into the city . Then Joab came to Jerusalem . 

$ 12:19:16 When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel , they sent messengers , and called out the Syrians who were beyond the River , with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadadezer leading them . 

$ 12:19:17 David was told that ; so he gathered all Israel together , passed over the Jordan , came to them , and set the battle in array against them . So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians , they fought with him . 

$ 12:19:18 The Syrians fled before Israel ; and David killed of the Syrian men seven thousand chariots , and forty thousand footmen , and also killed Shophach the captain of the army . 

$ 12:19:19 When the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel , they made peace with David , and served him . The Syrians would not help the children of Ammon any more . 


$ 12:20:1 At the time of the return of the year , at the time when kings go out , Joab led out the army , and wasted the country of the children of Ammon , and came and besieged Rabbah . But David stayed at Jerusalem . Joab struck Rabbah , and overthrew it . 

$ 12:20:2 David took the crown of their king from off his head , and found it to weigh a talent of gold , and there were precious stones in it . It was set on David's head , and he brought very much plunder out of the city . 

$ 12:20:3 He brought out the people who were in it , and had them cut with saws , with iron picks , and with axes . David did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon . Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem . 

$ 12:20:4 After this , war arose at Gezer with the Philistines . Then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai , of the sons of the giant ; and they were subdued . 

$ 12:20:5 Again there was war with the Philistines ; and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite , the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam . 

$ 12:20:6 There was again war at Gath , where there was a man of great stature , who had twenty - four fingers and toes , six on each hand , and six on each foot ; and he also was born to the giant . 

$ 12:20:7 When he defied Israel , Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother killed him . 

$ 12:20:8 These were born to the giant in Gath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants . 


$ 12:21:1 Satan stood up against Israel , and moved David to take a census of Israel . 

$ 12:21:2 David said to Joab and to the princes of the people , <" Go , count Israel from Beersheba even to Dan ; and bring me word , that I may know how many there are . >" 

$ 12:21:3 Joab said , <" May Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many as they are . But , my lord the king , aren't they all my lord's servants ? Why does my lord require this thing ? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel ? >" 

$ 12:21:4 Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab . Therefore Joab departed , and went throughout all Israel , then came to Jerusalem . 

$ 12:21:5 Joab gave up the sum of the census of the people to David . All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew a sword ; and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew a sword . 

$ 12:21:6 But he didn't count Levi and Benjamin among them ; for the king's word was abominable to Joab . 

$ 12:21:7 God was displeased with this thing ; therefore he struck Israel . 

$ 12:21:8 David said to God , <" I have sinned greatly , in that I have done this thing . But now put away , I beg you , the iniquity of your servant ; for I have done very foolishly . >" 

$ 12:21:9 Yahweh spoke to Gad , David's seer , saying , 

$ 12:21:10 <" Go and speak to David , saying , <' Yahweh says , <" I offer you three things . Choose one of them , that I may do it to you . >" >' >" 

$ 12:21:11 So Gad came to David , and said to him , <" Yahweh says , <' Take your choice : 

$ 12:21:12 either three years of famine ; or three months to be consumed before your foes , while the sword of your enemies overtakes you ; or else three days the sword of Yahweh , even pestilence in the land , and Yahweh's angel destroying throughout all the borders of Israel . Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me . >' >" 

$ 12:21:13 David said to Gad , <" I am in distress . Let me fall , I pray , into Yahweh's hand ; for his mercies are very great . Don't let me fall into man's hand . >" 

$ 12:21:14 So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel , and seventy thousand men of Israel fell . 

$ 12:21:15 God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it . As he was about to destroy , Yahweh saw , and he relented of the disaster , and said to the destroying angel , <" It is enough . Now withdraw your hand . >" Yahweh's angel was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite . 

$ 12:21:16 David lifted up his eyes , and saw Yahweh's angel standing between earth and the sky , having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem . Then David and the elders , clothed in sackcloth , fell on their faces . 

$ 12:21:17 David said to God , <" Isn't it I who commanded the people to be counted ? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly ; but these sheep , what have they done ? Please let your hand , O Yahweh my God , be against me , and against my father's house ; but not against your people , that they should be plagued . >" 

$ 12:21:18 Then Yahweh's angel commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up and raise an altar to Yahweh on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite . 

$ 12:21:19 David went up at the saying of Gad , which he spoke in Yahweh's name . 

$ 12:21:20 Ornan turned back , and saw the angel ; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves . Now Ornan was threshing wheat . 

$ 12:21:21 As David came to Ornan , Ornan looked and saw David , and went out of the threshing floor , and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground . 

$ 12:21:22 Then David said to Ornan , <" Give me the place of this threshing floor , that I may build an altar to Yahweh on it . You shall sell it to me for the full price , that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people . >" 

$ 12:21:23 Ornan said to David , <" Take it for yourself , and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes . Behold , I give the oxen for burnt offerings , and the threshing instruments for wood , and the wheat for the meal offering . I give it all . >" 

$ 12:21:24 King David said to Ornan , <" No ; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price . For I will not take that which is yours for Yahweh , nor offer a burnt offering that costs me nothing . >" 

$ 12:21:25 So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place . 

$ 12:21:26 David built an altar to Yahweh there , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings , and called on Yahweh ; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering . 

$ 12:21:27 Then Yahweh commanded the angel , and he put his sword back into its sheath . 

$ 12:21:28 At that time , when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite , then he sacrificed there . 

$ 12:21:29 For Yahweh's tabernacle , which Moses made in the wilderness , and the altar of burnt offering , were at that time in the high place at Gibeon . 

$ 12:21:30 But David couldn't go before it to inquire of God ; for he was afraid because of the sword of Yahweh's angel . 


$ 12:22:1 Then David said , <" This is the house of Yahweh God , and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel . >" 

$ 12:22:2 David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel ; and he set masons to cut dressed stones to build God's house . 

$ 12:22:3 David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates , and for the couplings ; and bronze in abundance without weight ; 

$ 12:22:4 and cedar trees without number , for the Sidonians and the people of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to David . 

$ 12:22:5 David said , <" Solomon my son is young and tender , and the house that is to be built for Yahweh must be exceedingly magnificent , of fame and of glory throughout all countries . I will therefore make preparation for it . >" So David prepared abundantly before his death . 

$ 12:22:6 Then he called for Solomon his son , and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh , the God of Israel . 

$ 12:22:7 David said to Solomon his son , <" As for me , it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God . 

$ 12:22:8 But Yahweh's word came to me , saying , <' You have shed blood abundantly , and have made great wars . You shall not build a house to my name , because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight . 

$ 12:22:9 Behold , a son shall be born to you , who shall be a man of peace . I will give him rest from all his enemies all around ; for his name shall be Solomon , and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days . 

$ 12:22:10 He shall build a house for my name ; and he will be my son , and I will be his father ; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever . >' 

$ 12:22:11 Now , my son , may Yahweh be with you and prosper you , and build the house of Yahweh your God , as he has spoken concerning you . 

$ 12:22:12 May Yahweh give you discretion and understanding , and put you in charge of Israel ; that so you may keep the law of Yahweh your God . 

$ 12:22:13 Then you will prosper , if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses concerning Israel . Be strong and courageous . Don't be afraid , and don't be dismayed . 

$ 12:22:14 Now , behold , in my affliction I have prepared for Yahweh's house one hundred thousand talents of gold , one million talents of silver , and bronze and iron without weight ; for it is in abundance . I have also prepared timber and stone ; and you may add to them . 

$ 12:22:15 There are also workmen with you in abundance , cutters and workers of stone and timber , and all kinds of men who are skillful in every kind of work ; 

$ 12:22:16 of the gold , the silver , the bronze , and the iron , there is no number . Arise and be doing , and may Yahweh be with you . >" 

$ 12:22:17 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son , saying , 

$ 12:22:18 <" Isn't Yahweh your God with you ? Hasn't he given you rest on every side ? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand ; and the land is subdued before Yahweh , and before his people . 

$ 12:22:19 Now set your heart and your soul to follow Yahweh your God . Arise therefore , and build the sanctuary of Yahweh God , to bring the ark of Yahweh's covenant and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built for Yahweh's name . >" 


$ 12:23:1 Now David was old and full of days ; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel . 

$ 12:23:2 He gathered together all the princes of Israel , with the priests and the Levites . 

$ 12:23:3 The Levites were counted from thirty years old and upward ; and their number by their polls , man by man , was thirty - eight thousand . 

$ 12:23:4 David said , <" Of these , twenty - four thousand were to oversee the work of Yahweh's house , six thousand were officers and judges , 

$ 12:23:5 four thousand were doorkeepers , and four thousand praised Yahweh with the instruments which I made for giving praise . >" 

$ 12:23:6 David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi : Gershon , Kohath , and Merari . 

$ 12:23:7 Of the Gershonites : Ladan and Shimei . 

$ 12:23:8 The sons of Ladan : Jehiel the chief , Zetham , and Joel , three . 

$ 12:23:9 The sons of Shimei : Shelomoth , Haziel , and Haran , three . These were the heads of the fathers' households of Ladan . 

$ 12:23:10 The sons of Shimei : Jahath , Zina , Jeush , and Beriah . These four were the sons of Shimei . 

$ 12:23:11 Jahath was the chief , and Zizah the second ; but Jeush and Beriah didn't have many sons ; therefore they became a fathers' house in one reckoning . 

$ 12:23:12 The sons of Kohath : Amram , Izhar , Hebron , and Uzziel , four . 

$ 12:23:13 The sons of Amram : Aaron and Moses ; and Aaron was separated , that he should sanctify the most holy things , he and his sons , forever , to burn incense before Yahweh , to minister to him , and to bless in his name , forever . 

$ 12:23:14 But as for Moses the man of God , his sons were named among the tribe of Levi . 

$ 12:23:15 The sons of Moses : Gershom and Eliezer . 

$ 12:23:16 The sons of Gershom : Shebuel the chief . 

$ 12:23:17 The sons of Eliezer were : Rehabiah the chief ; and Eliezer had no other sons ; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many . 

$ 12:23:18 The sons of Izhar : Shelomith the chief . 

$ 12:23:19 The sons of Hebron : Jeriah the chief , Amariah the second , Jahaziel the third , and Jekameam the fourth . 

$ 12:23:20 The sons of Uzziel : Micah the chief , and Isshiah the second . 

$ 12:23:21 The sons of Merari : Mahli and Mushi . The sons of Mahli : Eleazar and Kish . 

$ 12:23:22 Eleazar died , and had no sons , but daughters only : and their brothers the sons of Kish took them as wives . 

$ 12:23:23 The sons of Mushi : Mahli , Eder , and Jeremoth , three . 

$ 12:23:24 These were the sons of Levi after their fathers' houses , even the heads of the fathers' houses of those who were counted individually , in the number of names by their polls , who did the work for the service of Yahweh's house , from twenty years old and upward . 

$ 12:23:25 For David said , <" Yahweh , the God of Israel , has given rest to his people ; and he dwells in Jerusalem forever . 

$ 12:23:26 Also the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service . >" 

$ 12:23:27 For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were counted , from twenty years old and upward . 

$ 12:23:28 For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of Yahweh's house , in the courts , and in the rooms , and in the purifying of all holy things , even the work of the service of God's house ; 

$ 12:23:29 for the show bread also , and for the fine flour for a meal offering , whether of unleavened wafers , or of that which is baked in the pan , or of that which is soaked , and for all measurements of quantity and size ; 

$ 12:23:30 and to stand every morning to thank and praise Yahweh , and likewise in the evening ; 

$ 12:23:31 and to offer all burnt offerings to Yahweh , on the Sabbaths , on the new moons , and on the set feasts , in number according to the ordinance concerning them , continually before Yahweh ; 

$ 12:23:32 and that they should keep the duty of the Tent of Meeting , the duty of the holy place , and the duty of the sons of Aaron their brothers , for the service of Yahweh's house . 


$ 12:24:1 These were the divisions of the sons of Aaron . The sons of Aaron : Nadab , Abihu , Eleazar , and Ithamar . 

$ 12:24:2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father , and had no children : therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office . 

$ 12:24:3 David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar , divided them according to their ordering in their service . 

$ 12:24:4 There were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar ; and they were divided like this : of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen , heads of fathers' houses ; and of the sons of Ithamar , according to their fathers' houses , eight . 

$ 12:24:5 Thus were they divided impartially by drawing lots ; for there were princes of the sanctuary , and princes of God , both of the sons of Eleazar , and of the sons of Ithamar . 

$ 12:24:6 Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe , who was of the Levites , wrote them in the presence of the king , the princes , Zadok the priest , Ahimelech the son of Abiathar , and the heads of the fathers' households of the priests and of the Levites ; one fathers' house being taken for Eleazar , and one taken for Ithamar . 

$ 12:24:7 Now the first lot came out to Jehoiarib , the second to Jedaiah , 

$ 12:24:8 the third to Harim , the fourth to Seorim , 

$ 12:24:9 the fifth to Malchijah , the sixth to Mijamin , 

$ 12:24:10 the seventh to Hakkoz , the eighth to Abijah , 

$ 12:24:11 the ninth to Jeshua , the tenth to Shecaniah , 

$ 12:24:12 the eleventh to Eliashib , the twelfth to Jakim , 

$ 12:24:13 the thirteenth to Huppah , the fourteenth to Jeshebeab , 

$ 12:24:14 the fifteenth to Bilgah , the sixteenth to Immer , 

$ 12:24:15 the seventeenth to Hezir , the eighteenth to Happizzez , 

$ 12:24:16 the nineteenth to Pethahiah , the twentieth to Jehezkel , 

$ 12:24:17 the twenty - first to Jachin , the twenty - second to Gamul , 

$ 12:24:18 the twenty - third to Delaiah , and the twenty - fourth to Maaziah . 

$ 12:24:19 This was their ordering in their service , to come into Yahweh's house according to the ordinance given to them by Aaron their father , as Yahweh , the God of Israel , had commanded him . 

$ 12:24:20 Of the rest of the sons of Levi : of the sons of Amram , Shubael ; of the sons of Shubael , Jehdeiah . 

$ 12:24:21 Of Rehabiah : of the sons of Rehabiah , Isshiah the chief . 

$ 12:24:22 Of the Izharites , Shelomoth ; of the sons of Shelomoth , Jahath . 

$ 12:24:23 The sons of Hebron : Jeriah , Amariah the second , Jahaziel the third , and Jekameam the fourth . 

$ 12:24:24 The sons of Uzziel : Micah ; of the sons of Micah , Shamir . 

$ 12:24:25 The brother of Micah : Isshiah ; of the sons of Isshiah , Zechariah . 

$ 12:24:26 The sons of Merari : Mahli and Mushi . The son of Jaaziah : Beno . 

$ 12:24:27 The sons of Merari : of Jaaziah , Beno , Shoham , Zaccur , and Ibri . 

$ 12:24:28 Of Mahli : Eleazar , who had no sons . 

$ 12:24:29 Of Kish , the son of Kish : Jerahmeel . 

$ 12:24:30 The sons of Mushi : Mahli , Eder , and Jerimoth . These were the sons of the Levites after their fathers' houses . 

$ 12:24:31 These likewise cast lots even as their brothers the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king , Zadok , Ahimelech , and the heads of the fathers' households of the priests and of the Levites ; the fathers' households of the chief even as those of his younger brother . 


$ 12:25:1 Moreover , David and the captains of the army set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph , and of Heman , and of Jeduthun , who were to prophesy with harps , with stringed instruments , and with cymbals . The number of those who did the work according to their service was : 

$ 12:25:2 of the sons of Asaph : Zaccur , Joseph , Nethaniah , and Asharelah . The sons of Asaph were under the hand of Asaph , who prophesied at the order of the king . 

$ 12:25:3 Of Jeduthun ; the sons of Jeduthun : Gedaliah , Zeri , Jeshaiah , Shimei , Hashabiah , and Mattithiah , six , under the hands of their father Jeduthun , who prophesied in giving thanks and praising Yahweh with the harp . 

$ 12:25:4 Of Heman ; the sons of Heman : Bukkiah , Mattaniah , Uzziel , Shebuel , Jerimoth , Hananiah , Hanani , Eliathah , Giddalti , Romamti - Ezer , Joshbekashah , Mallothi , Hothir , and Mahazioth . 

$ 12:25:5 All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God , to lift up the horn . God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters . 

$ 12:25:6 All these were under the hands of their father for song in Yahweh's house , with cymbals , stringed instruments , and harps , for the service of God's house ; Asaph , Jeduthun , and Heman being under the order of the king . 

$ 12:25:7 The number of them , with their brothers who were instructed in singing to Yahweh , even all who were skillful , was two hundred eighty - eight . 

$ 12:25:8 They cast lots for their offices , all alike , the small as well as the great , the teacher as well as the student .

$ 12:26:11 Hilkiah the second , Tebaliah the third , and Zechariah the fourth : all the sons and brothers of Hosah were thirteen . 

$ 12:26:12 Of these were the divisions of the doorkeepers , even of the chief men , having offices like their brothers , to minister in Yahweh's house . 

$ 12:26:13 They cast lots , the small as well as the great , according to their fathers' houses , for every gate .

$ 12:26:25 His brothers : of Eliezer , Rehabiah his son , and Jeshaiah his son , and Joram his son , and Zichri his son , and Shelomoth his son . 

$ 12:26:26 This Shelomoth and his brothers were over all the treasures of the dedicated things , which David the king , and the heads of the fathers' households , the captains over thousands and hundreds , and the captains of the army , had dedicated . 

$ 12:26:27 They dedicated some of the plunder won in battles to repair Yahweh's house . 

$ 12:26:28 All that Samuel the seer , and Saul the son of Kish , and Abner the son of Ner , and Joab the son of Zeruiah , had dedicated , whoever had dedicated anything , it was under the hand of Shelomoth , and of his brothers .

$ 12:27:1 Now the children of Israel after their number , the heads of fathers' households and the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and their officers who served the king , in any matter of the divisions which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year - of every division were twenty - four thousand .

$ 12:27:22 of Dan , Azarel the son of Jeroham . These were the captains of the tribes of Israel . 

$ 12:27:23 But David didn't take the number of them from twenty years old and under , because Yahweh had said he would increase Israel like the stars of the sky . 

$ 12:27:24 Joab the son of Zeruiah began to take a census , but didn't finish ; and wrath came on Israel for this . The number wasn't put into the account in the chronicles of king David . 

$ 12:27:25 Over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel : and over the treasures in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the towers , was Jonathan the son of Uzziah ; 

$ 12:27:26 Over those who did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub ; 

$ 12:27:27 and over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite ; and over the increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite ;

$ 12:27:31 All these were the rulers of the property which was king David's . 

$ 12:27:32 Also Jonathan , David's uncle , was a counselor , a man of understanding , and a scribe ; and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's sons . 

$ 12:27:33 Ahithophel was the king's counselor : and Hushai the Archite was the king's friend . 

$ 12:27:34 After Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah , and Abiathar . Joab was the captain of the king's army . 


$ 12:28:1 David assembled all the princes of Israel , the princes of the tribes , the captains of the companies who served the king by division , the captains of thousands , the captains of hundreds , and the rulers over all the substance and possessions of the king and of his sons , with the officers and the mighty men , even all the mighty men of valor , to Jerusalem . 

$ 12:28:2 Then David the king stood up on his feet , and said , <" Hear me , my brothers , and my people ! As for me , it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of Yahweh's covenant , and for the footstool of our God ; and I had prepared for the building . 

$ 12:28:3 But God said to me , <' You shall not build a house for my name , because you are a man of war , and have shed blood . >' 

$ 12:28:4 However Yahweh , the God of Israel , chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever . For he has chosen Judah to be prince ; and in the house of Judah , the house of my father ; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel . 

$ 12:28:5 Of all my sons ( for Yahweh has given me many sons ) , he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of Yahweh's kingdom over Israel . 

$ 12:28:6 He said to me , <' Solomon , your son , shall build my house and my courts ; for I have chosen him to be my son , and I will be his father . 

$ 12:28:7 I will establish his kingdom forever if he continues to do my commandments and my ordinances , as it is today . >' 

$ 12:28:8 Now therefore , in the sight of all Israel , Yahweh's assembly , and in the audience of our God , observe and seek out all the commandments of Yahweh your God ; that you may possess this good land , and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you forever . 

$ 12:28:9 You , Solomon my son , know the God of your father , and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind ; for Yahweh searches all hearts , and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts . If you seek him , he will be found by you ; but if you forsake him , he will cast you off forever . 

$ 12:28:10 Take heed now ; for Yahweh has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary . Be strong , and do it . >" 

$ 12:28:11 Then David gave to Solomon his son the plans for the porch of the temple , for its houses , for its treasuries , for its upper rooms , for its inner rooms , for the place of the mercy seat ; 

$ 12:28:12 and the plans of all that he had by the Spirit , for the courts of Yahweh's house , for all the surrounding rooms , for the treasuries of God's house , and for the treasuries of the dedicated things ; 

$ 12:28:13 also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites , for all the work of the service of Yahweh's house , and for all the vessels of service in Yahweh's house ; 

$ 12:28:14 of gold by weight for the gold , for all vessels of every kind of service ; for all the vessels of silver by weight , for all vessels of every kind of service ; 

$ 12:28:15 by weight also for the lamp stands of gold , and for its lamps , of gold , by weight for every lamp stand and for its lamps ; and for the lamp stands of silver , by weight for every lamp stand and for its lamps , according to the use of every lamp stand ; 

$ 12:28:16 and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread , for every table ; and silver for the tables of silver ; 

$ 12:28:17 and the forks , the basins , and the cups , of pure gold ; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl ; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl ; 

$ 12:28:18 and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight ; and gold for the plans for the chariot , and the cherubim that spread out and cover the ark of Yahweh's covenant . 

$ 12:28:19 <" All this >" , said David , <" I have been made to understand in writing from Yahweh's hand , even all the works of this pattern . >" 

$ 12:28:20 David said to Solomon his son , <" Be strong and courageous , and do it . Don't be afraid , nor be dismayed ; for Yahweh God , even my God , is with you . He will not fail you , nor forsake you , until all the work for the service of Yahweh's house is finished . 

$ 12:28:21 Behold , there are the divisions of the priests and the Levites , for all the service of God's house . Every willing man who has skill , for any kind of service , shall be with you in all kinds of work . Also the captains and all the people will be entirely at your command . >" 


$ 12:29:1 David the king said to all the assembly , <" Solomon my son , whom alone God has chosen , is yet young and tender , and the work is great ; for the palace is not for man , but for Yahweh God . 

$ 12:29:2 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the things of gold , the silver for the things of silver , the bronze for the things of bronze , iron for the things of iron , and wood for the things of wood ; also onyx stones , stones to be set , stones for inlaid work , of various colors , all kinds of precious stones , and marble stones in abundance . 

$ 12:29:3 In addition , because I have set my affection on the house of my God , since I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver , I give it to the house of my God , over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house , 

$ 12:29:4 even three thousand talents of gold , of the gold of Ophir , and seven thousand talents of refined silver , with which to overlay the walls of the houses ; 

$ 12:29:5 of gold for the things of gold , and of silver for the things of silver , and for all kinds of work to be made by the hands of artisans . Who then offers willingly to consecrate himself today to Yahweh ? >" 

$ 12:29:6 Then the princes of the fathers' households , and the princes of the tribes of Israel , and the captains of thousands and of hundreds , with the rulers over the king's work , offered willingly ; 

$ 12:29:7 and they gave for the service of God's house of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics , of silver ten thousand talents , of bronze eighteen thousand talents , and of iron one hundred thousand talents . 

$ 12:29:8 People with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of Yahweh's house , under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite . 

$ 12:29:9 Then the people rejoiced , because they offered willingly , because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Yahweh ; and David the king also rejoiced with great joy . 

$ 12:29:10 Therefore David blessed Yahweh before all the assembly ; and David said , <" You are blessed , Yahweh , the God of Israel our father , forever and ever . 

$ 12:29:11 Yours , Yahweh , is the greatness , the power , the glory , the victory , and the majesty ! For all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours . Yours is the kingdom , Yahweh , and you are exalted as head above all . 

$ 12:29:12 Both riches and honor come from you , and you rule over all ! In your hand is power and might ! It is in your hand to make great , and to give strength to all ! 

$ 12:29:13 Now therefore , our God , we thank you , and praise your glorious name . 

$ 12:29:14 But who am I , and what is my people , that we should be able to offer so willingly as this ? For all things come from you , and of your own have we given you . 

$ 12:29:15 For we are strangers before you , and foreigners , as all our fathers were . Our days on the earth are as a shadow , and there is no remaining . 

$ 12:29:16 Yahweh our God , all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand , and is all your own . 

$ 12:29:17 I know also , my God , that you try the heart , and have pleasure in uprightness . As for me , in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things . Now I have seen with joy your people , who are present here , offer willingly to you . 

$ 12:29:18 Yahweh , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Israel , our fathers , keep this desire forever in the thoughts of the heart of your people , and prepare their heart for you ; 

$ 12:29:19 and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep your commandments , your testimonies , and your statutes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for which I have made provision . >" 

$ 12:29:20 Then David said to all the assembly , <" Now bless Yahweh your God ! >" All the assembly blessed Yahweh , the God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves before Yahweh and the king . 

$ 12:29:21 They sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh , and offered burnt offerings to Yahweh , on the next day after that day , even one thousand bulls , one thousand rams , and one thousand lambs , with their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel , 

$ 12:29:22 and ate and drank before Yahweh on that day with great gladness . They made Solomon the son of David king the second time , and anointed him before Yahweh to be prince , and Zadok to be priest . 

$ 12:29:23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of Yahweh as king instead of David his father , and prospered ; and all Israel obeyed him . 

$ 12:29:24 All the princes , the mighty men , and also all of the sons of king David submitted themselves to Solomon the king . 

$ 12:29:25 Yahweh magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel , and gave to him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel . 

$ 12:29:26 Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel . 

$ 12:29:27 The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years ; he reigned seven years in Hebron , and he reigned thirty - three years in Jerusalem . 

$ 12:29:28 He died at a good old age , full of days , riches , and honor ; and Solomon his son reigned in his place . 

$ 12:29:29 Now the acts of David the king , first and last , behold , they are written in the history of Samuel the seer , and in the history of Nathan the prophet , and in the history of Gad the seer , 

$ 12:29:30 with all his reign and his might , and the times that went over him , and over Israel , and over all the kingdoms of the countries .
