$ 21:1:1 The Song of songs , which is Solomon's . Beloved 

$ 21:1:2 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth ; for your love is better than wine . 

$ 21:1:3 Your oils have a pleasing fragrance . Your name is oil poured out , therefore the virgins love you . 

$ 21:1:4 Take me away with you . Let's hurry . The king has brought me into his rooms . Friends We will be glad and rejoice in you . We will praise your love more than wine ! Beloved They are right to love you . 

$ 21:1:5 I am dark , but lovely , you daughters of Jerusalem , like Kedar's tents , like Solomon's curtains . 

$ 21:1:6 Don't stare at me because I am dark , because the sun has scorched me . My mother's sons were angry with me . They made me keeper of the vineyards . I haven't kept my own vineyard . 

$ 21:1:7 Tell me , you whom my soul loves , where you graze your flock , where you rest them at noon ; For why should I be as one who is veiled beside the flocks of your companions ? Lover 

$ 21:1:8 If you don't know , most beautiful among women , follow the tracks of the sheep . Graze your young goats beside the shepherds' tents . 

$ 21:1:9 I have compared you , my love , to a steed in Pharaoh's chariots . 

$ 21:1:10 Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings , your neck with strings of jewels . Friends 

$ 21:1:11 We will make you earrings of gold , with studs of silver . Beloved 

$ 21:1:12 While the king sat at his table , my perfume spread its fragrance . 

$ 21:1:13 My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh , that lies between my breasts . 

$ 21:1:14 My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms from the vineyards of En Gedi . Lover 

$ 21:1:15 Behold , you are beautiful , my love . Behold , you are beautiful . Your eyes are doves . Beloved 

$ 21:1:16 Behold , you are beautiful , my beloved , yes , pleasant ; and our couch is verdant . Lover 

$ 21:1:17 The beams of our house are cedars . Our rafters are firs . 
Beloved 

$ 21:2:1 I am a rose of Sharon , a lily of the valleys . Lover 

$ 21:2:2 As a lily among thorns , so is my love among the daughters . Beloved 

$ 21:2:3 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood , so is my beloved among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great delight , his fruit was sweet to my taste . 

$ 21:2:4 He brought me to the banquet hall . His banner over me is love . 

$ 21:2:5 Strengthen me with raisins , refresh me with apples ; For I am faint with love . 

$ 21:2:6 His left hand is under my head . His right hand embraces me . 

$ 21:2:7 I adjure you , daughters of Jerusalem , by the roes , or by the hinds of the field , that you not stir up , nor awaken love , until it so desires . 

$ 21:2:8 The voice of my beloved ! Behold , he comes , leaping on the mountains , skipping on the hills . 

$ 21:2:9 My beloved is like a roe or a young deer . Behold , he stands behind our wall ! He looks in at the windows . He glances through the lattice . 

$ 21:2:10 My beloved spoke , and said to me , <" Rise up , my love , my beautiful one , and come away . 

$ 21:2:11 For , behold , the winter is past . The rain is over and gone . 

$ 21:2:12 The flowers appear on the earth . The time of the singing has come , and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land . 

$ 21:2:13 The fig tree ripens her green figs . The vines are in blossom . They give out their fragrance . Arise , my love , my beautiful one , and come away . >" Lover 

$ 21:2:14 My dove in the clefts of the rock , In the hiding places of the mountainside , Let me see your face . Let me hear your voice ; for your voice is sweet , and your face is lovely . 

$ 21:2:15 Catch for us the foxes , the little foxes that plunder the vineyards ; for our vineyards are in blossom . Beloved 

$ 21:2:16 My beloved is mine , and I am his . He browses among the lilies . 

$ 21:2:17 Until the day is cool , and the shadows flee away , turn , my beloved , and be like a roe or a young deer on the mountains of Bether . 


$ 21:3:1 By night on my bed , I sought him whom my soul loves . I sought him , but I didn't find him . 

$ 21:3:2 I will get up now , and go about the city ; in the streets and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves . I sought him , but I didn't find him . 

$ 21:3:3 The watchmen who go about the city found me ; <" Have you seen him whom my soul loves ? >" 

$ 21:3:4 I had scarcely passed from them , when I found him whom my soul loves . I held him , and would not let him go , until I had brought him into my mother's house , into the room of her who conceived me . 

$ 21:3:5 I adjure you , daughters of Jerusalem , by the roes , or by the hinds of the field , that you not stir up , nor awaken love , until it so desires . 

$ 21:3:6 Who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars of smoke , perfumed with myrrh and frankincense , with all spices of the merchant ? 

$ 21:3:7 Behold , it is Solomon's carriage ! Sixty mighty men are around it , of the mighty men of Israel . 

$ 21:3:8 They all handle the sword , and are expert in war . Every man has his sword on his thigh , because of fear in the night . 

$ 21:3:9 King Solomon made himself a carriage of the wood of Lebanon . 

$ 21:3:10 He made its pillars of silver , its bottom of gold , its seat of purple , the middle of it being paved with love , from the daughters of Jerusalem . 

$ 21:3:11 Go out , you daughters of Zion , and see king Solomon , with the crown with which his mother has crowned him , in the day of his weddings , in the day of the gladness of his heart . 
Lover 

$ 21:4:1 Behold , you are beautiful , my love . Behold , you are beautiful . Your eyes are doves behind your veil . Your hair is as a flock of goats , that descend from Mount Gilead . 

$ 21:4:2 Your teeth are like a newly shorn flock , which have come up from the washing , where every one of them has twins . None is bereaved among them . 

$ 21:4:3 Your lips are like scarlet thread . Your mouth is lovely . Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil . 

$ 21:4:4 Your neck is like David's tower built for an armory , whereon a thousand shields hang , all the shields of the mighty men . 

$ 21:4:5 Your two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe , which feed among the lilies . 

$ 21:4:6 Until the day is cool , and the shadows flee away , I will go to the mountain of myrrh , to the hill of frankincense . 

$ 21:4:7 You are all beautiful , my love . There is no spot in you . 

$ 21:4:8 Come with me from Lebanon , my bride , with me from Lebanon . Look from the top of Amana , from the top of Senir and Hermon , from the lions' dens , from the mountains of the leopards . 

$ 21:4:9 You have ravished my heart , my sister , my bride . You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes , with one chain of your neck . 

$ 21:4:10 How beautiful is your love , my sister , my bride ! How much better is your love than wine ! The fragrance of your perfumes than all kinds of spices ! 

$ 21:4:11 Your lips , my bride , drip like the honeycomb . Honey and milk are under your tongue . The smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon . 

$ 21:4:12 A locked up garden is my sister , my bride ; a locked up spring , a sealed fountain . 

$ 21:4:13 Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates , with precious fruits : henna with spikenard plants , 

$ 21:4:14 spikenard and saffron , calamus and cinnamon , with every kind of incense tree ; myrrh and aloes , with all the best spices , 

$ 21:4:15 a fountain of gardens , a well of living waters , flowing streams from Lebanon . Beloved 

$ 21:4:16 Awake , north wind ; and come , you south ! Blow on my garden , that its spices may flow out . Let my beloved come into his garden , and taste his precious fruits . 
Lover 

$ 21:5:1 I have come into my garden , my sister , my bride . I have gathered my myrrh with my spice ; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey ; I have drunk my wine with my milk . Friends Eat , friends ! Drink , yes , drink abundantly , beloved . Beloved 

$ 21:5:2 I was asleep , but my heart was awake . It is the voice of my beloved who knocks : <" Open to me , my sister , my love , my dove , my undefiled ; for my head is filled with dew , and my hair with the dampness of the night . >" 

$ 21:5:3 I have taken off my robe . Indeed , must I put it on ? I have washed my feet . Indeed , must I soil them ? 

$ 21:5:4 My beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening . My heart pounded for him . 

$ 21:5:5 I rose up to open for my beloved . My hands dripped with myrrh , my fingers with liquid myrrh , on the handles of the lock . 

$ 21:5:6 I opened to my beloved ; but my beloved left ; and had gone away . My heart went out when he spoke . I looked for him , but I didn't find him . I called him , but he didn't answer . 

$ 21:5:7 The watchmen who go about the city found me . They beat me . They bruised me . The keepers of the walls took my cloak away from me . 

$ 21:5:8 I adjure you , daughters of Jerusalem , If you find my beloved , that you tell him that I am faint with love . Friends 

$ 21:5:9 How is your beloved better than another beloved , you fairest among women ? How is your beloved better than another beloved , that you do so adjure us ? Beloved 

$ 21:5:10 My beloved is white and ruddy . The best among ten thousand . 

$ 21:5:11 His head is like the purest gold . His hair is bushy , black as a raven . 

$ 21:5:12 His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks , washed with milk , mounted like jewels . 

$ 21:5:13 His cheeks are like a bed of spices with towers of perfumes . His lips are like lilies , dropping liquid myrrh . 

$ 21:5:14 His hands are like rings of gold set with beryl . His body is like ivory work overlaid with sapphires . 

$ 21:5:15 His legs are like pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold . His appearance is like Lebanon , excellent as the cedars . 

$ 21:5:16 His mouth is sweetness ; yes , he is altogether lovely . This is my beloved , and this is my friend , daughters of Jerusalem . 
Friends 

$ 21:6:1 Where has your beloved gone , you fairest among women ? Where has your beloved turned , that we may seek him with you ? Beloved 

$ 21:6:2 My beloved has gone down to his garden , to the beds of spices , to feed in the gardens , and to gather lilies . 

$ 21:6:3 I am my beloved's , and my beloved is mine . He browses among the lilies , Lover 

$ 21:6:4 You are beautiful , my love , as Tirzah , lovely as Jerusalem , awesome as an army with banners . 

$ 21:6:5 Turn away your eyes from me , for they have overcome me . Your hair is like a flock of goats , that lie along the side of Gilead . 

$ 21:6:6 Your teeth are like a flock of ewes , which have come up from the washing ; of which every one has twins ; no one is bereaved among them . 

$ 21:6:7 Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil . 

$ 21:6:8 There are sixty queens , eighty concubines , and virgins without number . 

$ 21:6:9 My dove , my perfect one , is unique . She is her mother's only daughter . She is the favorite one of her who bore her . The daughters saw her , and called her blessed ; the queens and the concubines , and they praised her . 

$ 21:6:10 Who is she who looks out as the morning , beautiful as the moon , clear as the sun , and awesome as an army with banners ? 

$ 21:6:11 I went down into the nut tree grove , to see the green plants of the valley , to see whether the vine budded , and the pomegranates were in flower . 

$ 21:6:12 Without realizing it , my desire set me with my royal people's chariots . Friends 

$ 21:6:13 Return , return , Shulammite ! Return , return , that we may gaze at you . Lover Why do you desire to gaze at the Shulammite , as at the dance of Mahanaim ? 


$ 21:7:1 How beautiful are your feet in sandals , prince's daughter ! Your rounded thighs are like jewels , the work of the hands of a skillful workman . 

$ 21:7:2 Your body is like a round goblet , no mixed wine is wanting . Your waist is like a heap of wheat , set about with lilies . 

$ 21:7:3 Your two breasts are like two fawns , that are twins of a roe . 

$ 21:7:4 Your neck is like an ivory tower . Your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bathrabbim . Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus . 

$ 21:7:5 Your head on you is like Carmel . The hair of your head like purple . The king is held captive in its tresses . 

$ 21:7:6 How beautiful and how pleasant you are , love , for delights ! 

$ 21:7:7 This , your stature , is like a palm tree , your breasts like its fruit . 

$ 21:7:8 I said , <" I will climb up into the palm tree . I will take hold of its fruit . >" Let your breasts be like clusters of the vine , the smell of your breath like apples , Beloved 

$ 21:7:9 Your mouth like the best wine , that goes down smoothly for my beloved , gliding through the lips of those who are asleep . 

$ 21:7:10 I am my beloved's . His desire is toward me . 

$ 21:7:11 Come , my beloved ! Let's go out into the field . Let's lodge in the villages . 

$ 21:7:12 Let's go early up to the vineyards . Let's see whether the vine has budded , its blossom is open , and the pomegranates are in flower . There I will give you my love . 

$ 21:7:13 The mandrakes produce fragrance . At our doors are all kinds of precious fruits , new and old , which I have stored up for you , my beloved . 


$ 21:8:1 Oh that you were like my brother , who nursed from the breasts of my mother ! If I found you outside , I would kiss you ; yes , and no one would despise me . 

$ 21:8:2 I would lead you , bringing you into my mother's house , who would instruct me . I would have you drink spiced wine , of the juice of my pomegranate . 

$ 21:8:3 His left hand would be under my head . His right hand would embrace me . 

$ 21:8:4 I adjure you , daughters of Jerusalem , that you not stir up , nor awaken love , until it so desires . Friends 

$ 21:8:5 Who is this who comes up from the wilderness , leaning on her beloved ? Beloved Under the apple tree I aroused you . There your mother conceived you . There she was in labor and bore you . 

$ 21:8:6 Set me as a seal on your heart , as a seal on your arm ; for love is strong as death . Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol . Its flashes are flashes of fire , a very flame of Yahweh . 

$ 21:8:7 Many waters can't quench love , neither can floods drown it . If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love , he would be utterly scorned . Brothers 

$ 21:8:8 We have a little sister . She has no breasts . What shall we do for our sister in the day when she is to be spoken for ? 

$ 21:8:9 If she is a wall , we will build on her a turret of silver . if she is a door , we will enclose her with boards of cedar . Beloved 

$ 21:8:10 I am a wall , and my breasts like towers , then I was in his eyes like one who found peace . 

$ 21:8:11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon . He leased out the vineyard to keepers . Each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit . 

$ 21:8:12 My own vineyard is before me . The thousand are for you , Solomon ; two hundred for those who tend its fruit . Lover 

$ 21:8:13 You who dwell in the gardens , with friends in attendance , let me hear your voice ! Beloved 

$ 21:8:14 Come away , my beloved ! Be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices !
