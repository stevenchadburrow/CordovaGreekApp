$ 11:1:1 Paul , an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God , and Timothy our brother , 

$ 11:1:2 to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae : Grace to you and peace from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ . 

$ 11:1:3 We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , praying always for you , 

$ 11:1:4 having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus , and of the love which you have toward all the saints , 

$ 11:1:5 because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens , of which you heard before in the word of the truth of the Good News , 

$ 11:1:6 which has come to you ; even as it is in all the world and is bearing fruit and growing , as it does in you also , since the day you heard and knew the grace of God in truth ; 

$ 11:1:7 even as you learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow servant , who is a faithful servant of Christ on your behalf , 

$ 11:1:8 who also declared to us your love in the Spirit . 

$ 11:1:9 For this cause , we also , since the day we heard this , don't cease praying and making requests for you , that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding , 

$ 11:1:10 that you may walk worthily of the Lord , to please him in all respects , bearing fruit in every good work , and increasing in the knowledge of God ; 

$ 11:1:11 strengthened with all power , according to the might of his glory , for all endurance and perseverance with joy ; 

$ 11:1:12 giving thanks to the Father , who made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light ; 

$ 11:1:13 who delivered us out of the power of darkness , and translated us into the Kingdom of the Son of his love ; 

$ 11:1:14 in whom we have our redemption , the forgiveness of our sins ; 

$ 11:1:15 who is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn of all creation . 

$ 11:1:16 For by him all things were created , in the heavens and on the earth , things visible and things invisible , whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers ; all things have been created through him , and for him . 

$ 11:1:17 He is before all things , and in him all things are held together . 

$ 11:1:18 He is the head of the body , the assembly , who is the beginning , the firstborn from the dead ; that in all things he might have the preeminence . 

$ 11:1:19 For all the fullness was pleased to dwell in him ; 

$ 11:1:20 and through him to reconcile all things to himself , by him , whether things on the earth , or things in the heavens , having made peace through the blood of his cross . 

$ 11:1:21 You , being in past times alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil deeds , 

$ 11:1:22 yet now he has reconciled in the body of his flesh through death , to present you holy and without defect and blameless before him , 

$ 11:1:23 if it is so that you continue in the faith , grounded and steadfast , and not moved away from the hope of the Good News which you heard , which is being proclaimed in all creation under heaven ; of which I , Paul , was made a servant . 

$ 11:1:24 Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake , and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake , which is the assembly ; 

$ 11:1:25 of which I was made a servant , according to the stewardship of God which was given me toward you , to fulfill the word of God , 

$ 11:1:26 the mystery which has been hidden for ages and generations . But now it has been revealed to his saints , 

$ 11:1:27 to whom God was pleased to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles , which is Christ in you , the hope of glory ; 

$ 11:1:28 whom we proclaim , admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom , that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus ; 

$ 11:1:29 for which I also labor , striving according to his working , which works in me mightily . 


$ 11:2:1 For I desire to have you know how greatly I struggle for you , and for those at Laodicea , and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh ; 

$ 11:2:2 that their hearts may be comforted , they being knit together in love , and gaining all riches of the full assurance of understanding , that they may know the mystery of God , both of the Father and of Christ , 

$ 11:2:3 in whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden . 

$ 11:2:4 Now this I say that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech . 

$ 11:2:5 For though I am absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , rejoicing and seeing your order , and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ . 

$ 11:2:6 As therefore you received Christ Jesus , the Lord , walk in him , 

$ 11:2:7 rooted and built up in him , and established in the faith , even as you were taught , abounding in it in thanksgiving . 

$ 11:2:8 Be careful that you don't let anyone rob you through his philosophy and vain deceit , after the tradition of men , after the elements of the world , and not after Christ . 

$ 11:2:9 For in him all the fullness of the Deity dwells bodily , 

$ 11:2:10 and in him you are made full , who is the head of all principality and power ; 

$ 11:2:11 in whom you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands , in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh , in the circumcision of Christ ; 

$ 11:2:12 having been buried with him in baptism , in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God , who raised him from the dead . 

$ 11:2:13 You were dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh . He made you alive together with him , having forgiven us all our trespasses , 

$ 11:2:14 wiping out the handwriting in ordinances which was against us ; and he has taken it out of the way , nailing it to the cross ; 

$ 11:2:15 having stripped the principalities and the powers , he made a show of them openly , triumphing over them in it . 

$ 11:2:16 Let no one therefore judge you in eating , or in drinking , or with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day , 

$ 11:2:17 which are a shadow of the things to come ; but the body is Christ's . 

$ 11:2:18 Let no one rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and worshiping of the angels , dwelling in the things which he has not seen , vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind , 

$ 11:2:19 and not holding firmly to the Head , from whom all the body , being supplied and knit together through the joints and ligaments , grows with God's growth . 

$ 11:2:20 If you died with Christ from the elements of the world , why , as though living in the world , do you subject yourselves to ordinances , 

$ 11:2:21 <" Don't handle , nor taste , nor touch >" 

$ 11:2:22 ( all of which perish with use ) , according to the precepts and doctrines of men ? 

$ 11:2:23 Which things indeed appear like wisdom in self - imposed worship , and humility , and severity to the body ; but aren't of any value against the indulgence of the flesh . 


$ 11:3:1 If then you were raised together with Christ , seek the things that are above , where Christ is , seated on the right hand of God . 

$ 11:3:2 Set your mind on the things that are above , not on the things that are on the earth . 

$ 11:3:3 For you died , and your life is hidden with Christ in God . 

$ 11:3:4 When Christ , our life , is revealed , then you will also be revealed with him in glory . 

$ 11:3:5 Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth : sexual immorality , uncleanness , depraved passion , evil desire , and covetousness , which is idolatry ; 

$ 11:3:6 for which things' sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience . 

$ 11:3:7 You also once walked in those , when you lived in them ; 

$ 11:3:8 but now you also put them all away : anger , wrath , malice , slander , and shameful speaking out of your mouth . 

$ 11:3:9 Don't lie to one another , seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings , 

$ 11:3:10 and have put on the new man , who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator , 

$ 11:3:11 where there can't be Greek and Jew , circumcision and uncircumcision , barbarian , Scythian , bondservant , freeman ; but Christ is all , and in all . 

$ 11:3:12 Put on therefore , as God's chosen ones , holy and beloved , a heart of compassion , kindness , lowliness , humility , and perseverance ; 

$ 11:3:13 bearing with one another , and forgiving each other , if any man has a complaint against any ; even as Christ forgave you , so you also do . 

$ 11:3:14 Above all these things , walk in love , which is the bond of perfection . 

$ 11:3:15 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts , to which also you were called in one body ; and be thankful . 

$ 11:3:16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly ; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs , singing with grace in your heart to the Lord . 

$ 11:3:17 Whatever you do , in word or in deed , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God the Father , through him . 

$ 11:3:18 Wives , be in subjection to your husbands , as is fitting in the Lord . 

$ 11:3:19 Husbands , love your wives , and don't be bitter against them . 

$ 11:3:20 Children , obey your parents in all things , for this pleases the Lord . 

$ 11:3:21 Fathers , don't provoke your children , so that they won't be discouraged . 

$ 11:3:22 Servants , obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh , not just when they are looking , as men pleasers , but in singleness of heart , fearing God . 

$ 11:3:23 And whatever you do , work heartily , as for the Lord , and not for men , 

$ 11:3:24 knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance ; for you serve the Lord Christ . 

$ 11:3:25 But he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done , and there is no partiality . 


$ 11:4:1 Masters , give to your servants that which is just and equal , knowing that you also have a Master in heaven . 

$ 11:4:2 Continue steadfastly in prayer , watching therein with thanksgiving ; 

$ 11:4:3 praying together for us also , that God may open to us a door for the word , to speak the mystery of Christ , for which I am also in bonds ; 

$ 11:4:4 that I may reveal it as I ought to speak . 

$ 11:4:5 Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside , redeeming the time . 

$ 11:4:6 Let your speech always be with grace , seasoned with salt , that you may know how you ought to answer each one . 

$ 11:4:7 All my affairs will be made known to you by Tychicus , the beloved brother , faithful servant , and fellow bondservant in the Lord . 

$ 11:4:8 I am sending him to you for this very purpose , that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts , 

$ 11:4:9 together with Onesimus , the faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you . They will make known to you everything that is going on here . 

$ 11:4:10 Aristarchus , my fellow prisoner , greets you , and Mark , the cousin of Barnabas ( concerning whom you received commandments , <" if he comes to you , receive him >" ) , 

$ 11:4:11 and Jesus who is called Justus . These are my only fellow workers for God's Kingdom who are of the circumcision , men who have been a comfort to me . 

$ 11:4:12 Epaphras , who is one of you , a servant of Christ , salutes you , always striving for you in his prayers , that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God . 

$ 11:4:13 For I testify about him , that he has great zeal for you , and for those in Laodicea , and for those in Hierapolis . 

$ 11:4:14 Luke , the beloved physician , and Demas greet you . 

$ 11:4:15 Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea , and Nymphas , and the assembly that is in his house . 

$ 11:4:16 When this letter has been read among you , cause it to be read also in the assembly of the Laodiceans ; and that you also read the letter from Laodicea . 

$ 11:4:17 Tell Archippus , <" Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord , that you fulfill it . >" 

$ 11:4:18 The salutation of me , Paul , with my own hand : remember my bonds . Grace be with you . Amen .
