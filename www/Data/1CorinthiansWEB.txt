$ 6:1:1 Paul , called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God , and our brother Sosthenes , 

$ 6:1:2 to the assembly of God which is at Corinth - those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus , called saints , with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place , both theirs and ours : 

$ 6:1:3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ . 

$ 6:1:4 I always thank my God concerning you , for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus ; 

$ 6:1:5 that in everything you were enriched in him , in all speech and all knowledge ; 

$ 6:1:6 even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you : 

$ 6:1:7 so that you come behind in no gift ; waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ ; 

$ 6:1:8 who will also confirm you until the end , blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ . 

$ 6:1:9 God is faithful , through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son , Jesus Christ , our Lord . 

$ 6:1:10 Now I beg you , brothers , through the name of our Lord , Jesus Christ , that you all speak the same thing , and that there be no divisions among you , but that you be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment . 

$ 6:1:11 For it has been reported to me concerning you , my brothers , by those who are from Chloe's household , that there are contentions among you . 

$ 6:1:12 Now I mean this , that each one of you says , <" I follow Paul , >" <" I follow Apollos , >" <" I follow Cephas , >" and , <" I follow Christ . >" 

$ 6:1:13 Is Christ divided ? Was Paul crucified for you ? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul ? 

$ 6:1:14 I thank God that I baptized none of you , except Crispus and Gaius , 

$ 6:1:15 so that no one should say that I had baptized you into my own name . 

$ 6:1:16 ( I also baptized the household of Stephanas ; besides them , I don't know whether I baptized any other . ) 

$ 6:1:17 For Christ sent me not to baptize , but to preach the Good News - not in wisdom of words , so that the cross of Christ wouldn't be made void . 

$ 6:1:18 For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying , but to us who are being saved it is the power of God . 

$ 6:1:19 For it is written , <" I will destroy the wisdom of the wise . I will bring the discernment of the discerning to nothing . >" 

$ 6:1:20 Where is the wise ? Where is the scribe ? Where is the lawyer of this world ? Hasn't God made foolish the wisdom of this world ? 

$ 6:1:21 For seeing that in the wisdom of God , the world through its wisdom didn't know God , it was God's good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe . 

$ 6:1:22 For Jews ask for signs , Greeks seek after wisdom , 

$ 6:1:23 but we preach Christ crucified ; a stumbling block to Jews , and foolishness to Greeks , 

$ 6:1:24 but to those who are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God ; 

$ 6:1:25 because the foolishness of God is wiser than men , and the weakness of God is stronger than men . 

$ 6:1:26 For you see your calling , brothers , that not many are wise according to the flesh , not many mighty , and not many noble ; 

$ 6:1:27 but God chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those who are wise . God chose the weak things of the world that he might put to shame the things that are strong . 

$ 6:1:28 God chose the lowly things of the world , and the things that are despised , and the things that don't exist , that he might bring to nothing the things that exist , 

$ 6:1:29 that no flesh should boast before God . 

$ 6:1:30 Because of him , you are in Christ Jesus , who was made to us wisdom from God , and righteousness and sanctification , and redemption : 

$ 6:1:31 that , as it is written , <" He who boasts , let him boast in the Lord . >" 


$ 6:2:1 When I came to you , brothers , I didn't come with excellence of speech or of wisdom , proclaiming to you the testimony of God . 

$ 6:2:2 For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified . 

$ 6:2:3 I was with you in weakness , in fear , and in much trembling . 

$ 6:2:4 My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power , 

$ 6:2:5 that your faith wouldn't stand in the wisdom of men , but in the power of God . 

$ 6:2:6 We speak wisdom , however , among those who are full grown , yet a wisdom not of this world nor of the rulers of this world who are coming to nothing . 

$ 6:2:7 But we speak God's wisdom in a mystery , the wisdom that has been hidden , which God foreordained before the worlds for our glory , 

$ 6:2:8 which none of the rulers of this world has known . For had they known it , they wouldn't have crucified the Lord of glory . 

$ 6:2:9 But as it is written , <" Things which an eye didn't see , and an ear didn't hear , which didn't enter into the heart of man , these God has prepared for those who love him . >" 

$ 6:2:10 But to us , God revealed them through the Spirit . For the Spirit searches all things , yes , the deep things of God . 

$ 6:2:11 For who among men knows the things of a man , except the spirit of the man , which is in him ? Even so , no one knows the things of God , except God's Spirit . 

$ 6:2:12 But we received not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit which is from God , that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God . 

$ 6:2:13 We also speak these things , not in words which man's wisdom teaches , but which the Holy Spirit teaches , comparing spiritual things with spiritual things . 

$ 6:2:14 Now the natural man doesn't receive the things of God's Spirit , for they are foolishness to him , and he can't know them , because they are spiritually discerned . 

$ 6:2:15 But he who is spiritual discerns all things , and he himself is judged by no one . 

$ 6:2:16 <" For who has known the mind of the Lord , that he should instruct him ? >" But we have Christ's mind . 


$ 6:3:1 Brothers , I couldn't speak to you as to spiritual , but as to fleshly , as to babies in Christ . 

$ 6:3:2 I fed you with milk , not with meat ; for you weren't yet ready . Indeed , you aren't ready even now , 

$ 6:3:3 for you are still fleshly . For insofar as there is jealousy , strife , and factions among you , aren't you fleshly , and don't you walk in the ways of men ? 

$ 6:3:4 For when one says , <" I follow Paul , >" and another , <" I follow Apollos , >" aren't you fleshly ? 

$ 6:3:5 Who then is Apollos , and who is Paul , but servants through whom you believed , and each as the Lord gave to him ? 

$ 6:3:6 I planted . Apollos watered . But God gave the increase . 

$ 6:3:7 So then neither he who plants is anything , nor he who waters , but God who gives the increase . 

$ 6:3:8 Now he who plants and he who waters are the same , but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor . 

$ 6:3:9 For we are God's fellow workers . You are God's farming , God's building . 

$ 6:3:10 According to the grace of God which was given to me , as a wise master builder I laid a foundation , and another builds on it . But let each man be careful how he builds on it . 

$ 6:3:11 For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid , which is Jesus Christ . 

$ 6:3:12 But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold , silver , costly stones , wood , hay , or stubble , 

$ 6:3:13 each man's work will be revealed . For the Day will declare it , because it is revealed in fire ; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man's work is . 

$ 6:3:14 If any man's work remains which he built on it , he will receive a reward . 

$ 6:3:15 If any man's work is burned , he will suffer loss , but he himself will be saved , but as through fire . 

$ 6:3:16 Don't you know that you are a temple of God , and that God's Spirit lives in you ? 

$ 6:3:17 If anyone destroys God's temple , God will destroy him ; for God's temple is holy , which you are . 

$ 6:3:18 Let no one deceive himself . If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world , let him become a fool , that he may become wise . 

$ 6:3:19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . For it is written , <" He has taken the wise in their craftiness . >" 

$ 6:3:20 And again , <" The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise , that it is worthless . >" 

$ 6:3:21 Therefore let no one boast in men . For all things are yours , 

$ 6:3:22 whether Paul , or Apollos , or Cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come . All are yours , 

$ 6:3:23 and you are Christ's , and Christ is God's . 


$ 6:4:1 So let a man think of us as Christ's servants , and stewards of God's mysteries . 

$ 6:4:2 Here , moreover , it is required of stewards that they be found faithful . 

$ 6:4:3 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you , or by man's judgment . Yes , I don't judge my own self . 

$ 6:4:4 For I know nothing against myself . Yet I am not justified by this , but he who judges me is the Lord . 

$ 6:4:5 Therefore judge nothing before the time , until the Lord comes , who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness , and reveal the counsels of the hearts . Then each man will get his praise from God . 

$ 6:4:6 Now these things , brothers , I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes , that in us you might learn not to think beyond the things which are written , that none of you be puffed up against one another . 

$ 6:4:7 For who makes you different ? And what do you have that you didn't receive ? But if you did receive it , why do you boast as if you had not received it ? 

$ 6:4:8 You are already filled . You have already become rich . You have come to reign without us . Yes , and I wish that you did reign , that we also might reign with you . 

$ 6:4:9 For , I think that God has displayed us , the apostles , last of all , like men sentenced to death . For we are made a spectacle to the world , both to angels and men . 

$ 6:4:10 We are fools for Christ's sake , but you are wise in Christ . We are weak , but you are strong . You have honor , but we have dishonor . 

$ 6:4:11 Even to this present hour we hunger , thirst , are naked , are beaten , and have no certain dwelling place . 

$ 6:4:12 We toil , working with our own hands . When people curse us , we bless . Being persecuted , we endure . 

$ 6:4:13 Being defamed , we entreat . We are made as the filth of the world , the dirt wiped off by all , even until now . 

$ 6:4:14 I don't write these things to shame you , but to admonish you as my beloved children . 

$ 6:4:15 For though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ , you don't have many fathers . For in Christ Jesus , I became your father through the Good News . 

$ 6:4:16 I beg you therefore , be imitators of me . 

$ 6:4:17 Because of this I have sent Timothy to you , who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord , who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ , even as I teach everywhere in every assembly . 

$ 6:4:18 Now some are puffed up , as though I were not coming to you . 

$ 6:4:19 But I will come to you shortly , if the Lord is willing . And I will know , not the word of those who are puffed up , but the power . 

$ 6:4:20 For God's Kingdom is not in word , but in power . 

$ 6:4:21 What do you want ? Shall I come to you with a rod , or in love and a spirit of gentleness ? 


$ 6:5:1 It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you , and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles , that one has his father's wife . 

$ 6:5:2 You are arrogant , and didn't mourn instead , that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you . 

$ 6:5:3 For I most certainly , as being absent in body but present in spirit , have already , as though I were present , judged him who has done this thing . 

$ 6:5:4 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , you being gathered together , and my spirit , with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ , 

$ 6:5:5 are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh , that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus . 

$ 6:5:6 Your boasting is not good . Don't you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump ? 

$ 6:5:7 Purge out the old yeast , that you may be a new lump , even as you are unleavened . For indeed Christ , our Passover , has been sacrificed in our place . 

$ 6:5:8 Therefore let's keep the feast , not with old yeast , neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness , but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth . 

$ 6:5:9 I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners ; 

$ 6:5:10 yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world , or with the covetous and extortionists , or with idolaters ; for then you would have to leave the world . 

$ 6:5:11 But as it is , I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner , or covetous , or an idolater , or a slanderer , or a drunkard , or an extortionist . Don't even eat with such a person . 

$ 6:5:12 For what do I have to do with also judging those who are outside ? Don't you judge those who are within ? 

$ 6:5:13 But those who are outside , God judges . <" Put away the wicked man from among yourselves . >" 


$ 6:6:1 Dare any of you , having a matter against his neighbor , go to law before the unrighteous , and not before the saints ? 

$ 6:6:2 Don't you know that the saints will judge the world ? And if the world is judged by you , are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters ? 

$ 6:6:3 Don't you know that we will judge angels ? How much more , things that pertain to this life ? 

$ 6:6:4 If then you have to judge things pertaining to this life , do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly ? 

$ 6:6:5 I say this to move you to shame . Isn't there even one wise man among you who would be able to decide between his brothers ? 

$ 6:6:6 But brother goes to law with brother , and that before unbelievers ! 

$ 6:6:7 Therefore it is already altogether a defect in you , that you have lawsuits one with another . Why not rather be wronged ? Why not rather be defrauded ? 

$ 6:6:8 No , but you yourselves do wrong and defraud , and that against your brothers . 

$ 6:6:9 Or don't you know that the unrighteous will not inherit God's Kingdom ? Don't be deceived . Neither the sexually immoral , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor male prostitutes , nor homosexuals , 

$ 6:6:10 nor thieves , nor covetous , nor drunkards , nor slanderers , nor extortionists , will inherit God's Kingdom . 

$ 6:6:11 Some of you were such , but you were washed . But you were sanctified . But you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and in the Spirit of our God . 

$ 6:6:12 <" All things are lawful for me , >" but not all things are expedient . <" All things are lawful for me , >" but I will not be brought under the power of anything . 

$ 6:6:13 <" Foods for the belly , and the belly for foods , >" but God will bring to nothing both it and them . But the body is not for sexual immorality , but for the Lord ; and the Lord for the body . 

$ 6:6:14 Now God raised up the Lord , and will also raise us up by his power . 

$ 6:6:15 Don't you know that your bodies are members of Christ ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute ? May it never be ! 

$ 6:6:16 Or don't you know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body ? For , <" The two >" , he says , <" will become one flesh . >" 

$ 6:6:17 But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit . 

$ 6:6:18 Flee sexual immorality ! <" Every sin that a man does is outside the body , >" but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body . 

$ 6:6:19 Or don't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you , whom you have from God ? You are not your own , 

$ 6:6:20 for you were bought with a price . Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit , which are God's . 


$ 6:7:1 Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me : it is good for a man not to touch a woman . 

$ 6:7:2 But , because of sexual immoralities , let each man have his own wife , and let each woman have her own husband . 

$ 6:7:3 Let the husband give his wife the affection owed her , and likewise also the wife her husband . 

$ 6:7:4 The wife doesn't have authority over her own body , but the husband . Likewise also the husband doesn't have authority over his own body , but the wife . 

$ 6:7:5 Don't deprive one another , unless it is by consent for a season , that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer , and may be together again , that Satan doesn't tempt you because of your lack of self - control . 

$ 6:7:6 But this I say by way of concession , not of commandment . 

$ 6:7:7 Yet I wish that all men were like me . However each man has his own gift from God , one of this kind , and another of that kind . 

$ 6:7:8 But I say to the unmarried and to widows , it is good for them if they remain even as I am . 

$ 6:7:9 But if they don't have self - control , let them marry . For it's better to marry than to burn . 

$ 6:7:10 But to the married I command - not I , but the Lord - that the wife not leave her husband 

$ 6:7:11 ( but if she departs , let her remain unmarried , or else be reconciled to her husband ) , and that the husband not leave his wife . 

$ 6:7:12 But to the rest I - not the Lord - say , if any brother has an unbelieving wife , and she is content to live with him , let him not leave her . 

$ 6:7:13 The woman who has an unbelieving husband , and he is content to live with her , let her not leave her husband . 

$ 6:7:14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband . Otherwise your children would be unclean , but now they are holy . 

$ 6:7:15 Yet if the unbeliever departs , let there be separation . The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases , but God has called us in peace . 

$ 6:7:16 For how do you know , wife , whether you will save your husband ? Or how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ? 

$ 6:7:17 Only , as the Lord has distributed to each man , as God has called each , so let him walk . So I command in all the assemblies . 

$ 6:7:18 Was anyone called having been circumcised ? Let him not become uncircumcised . Has anyone been called in uncircumcision ? Let him not be circumcised . 

$ 6:7:19 Circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is nothing , but the keeping of the commandments of God . 

$ 6:7:20 Let each man stay in that calling in which he was called . 

$ 6:7:21 Were you called being a bondservant ? Don't let that bother you , but if you get an opportunity to become free , use it . 

$ 6:7:22 For he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord's free man . Likewise he who was called being free is Christ's bondservant . 

$ 6:7:23 You were bought with a price . Don't become bondservants of men . 

$ 6:7:24 Brothers , let each man , in whatever condition he was called , stay in that condition with God . 

$ 6:7:25 Now concerning virgins , I have no commandment from the Lord , but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy . 

$ 6:7:26 Therefore I think that because of the distress that is on us , that it's good for a man to remain as he is . 

$ 6:7:27 Are you bound to a wife ? Don't seek to be freed . Are you free from a wife ? Don't seek a wife . 

$ 6:7:28 But if you marry , you have not sinned . If a virgin marries , she has not sinned . Yet such will have oppression in the flesh , and I want to spare you . 

$ 6:7:29 But I say this , brothers : the time is short , that from now on , both those who have wives may be as though they had none ; 

$ 6:7:30 and those who weep , as though they didn't weep ; and those who rejoice , as though they didn't rejoice ; and those who buy , as though they didn't possess ; 

$ 6:7:31 and those who use the world , as not using it to the fullest . For the mode of this world passes away . 

$ 6:7:32 But I desire to have you to be free from cares . He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord , how he may please the Lord ; 

$ 6:7:33 but he who is married is concerned about the things of the world , how he may please his wife . 

$ 6:7:34 There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin . The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord , that she may be holy both in body and in spirit . But she who is married cares about the things of the world - how she may please her husband . 

$ 6:7:35 This I say for your own profit ; not that I may ensnare you , but for that which is appropriate , and that you may attend to the Lord without distraction . 

$ 6:7:36 But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately toward his virgin , if she is past the flower of her age , and if need so requires , let him do what he desires . He doesn't sin . Let them marry . 

$ 6:7:37 But he who stands steadfast in his heart , having no urgency , but has power over his own will , and has determined in his own heart to keep his own virgin , does well . 

$ 6:7:38 So then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well , and he who doesn't give her in marriage does better . 

$ 6:7:39 A wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives ; but if the husband is dead , she is free to be married to whomever she desires , only in the Lord . 

$ 6:7:40 But she is happier if she stays as she is , in my judgment , and I think that I also have God's Spirit . 


$ 6:8:1 Now concerning things sacrificed to idols : We know that we all have knowledge . Knowledge puffs up , but love builds up . 

$ 6:8:2 But if anyone thinks that he knows anything , he doesn't yet know as he ought to know . 

$ 6:8:3 But if anyone loves God , the same is known by him . 

$ 6:8:4 Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols , we know that no idol is anything in the world , and that there is no other God but one . 

$ 6:8:5 For though there are things that are called <" gods >" , whether in the heavens or on earth ; as there are many <" gods >" and many <" lords >" ; 

$ 6:8:6 yet to us there is one God , the Father , of whom are all things , and we for him ; and one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom are all things , and we live through him . 

$ 6:8:7 However , that knowledge isn't in all men . But some , with consciousness of the idol until now , eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol , and their conscience , being weak , is defiled . 

$ 6:8:8 But food will not commend us to God . For neither , if we don't eat , are we the worse ; nor , if we eat , are we the better . 

$ 6:8:9 But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak . 

$ 6:8:10 For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol's temple , won't his conscience , if he is weak , be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols ? 

$ 6:8:11 And through your knowledge , he who is weak perishes , the brother for whose sake Christ died . 

$ 6:8:12 Thus , sinning against the brothers , and wounding their conscience when it is weak , you sin against Christ . 

$ 6:8:13 Therefore if food causes my brother to stumble , I will eat no meat forever more , that I don't cause my brother to stumble . 


$ 6:9:1 Am I not free ? Am I not an apostle ? Haven't I seen Jesus Christ , our Lord ? Aren't you my work in the Lord ? 

$ 6:9:2 If to others I am not an apostle , yet at least I am to you ; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord . 

$ 6:9:3 My defense to those who examine me is this : 

$ 6:9:4 Have we no right to eat and to drink ? 

$ 6:9:5 Have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer , even as the rest of the apostles , and the brothers of the Lord , and Cephas ? 

$ 6:9:6 Or have only Barnabas and I no right to not work ? 

$ 6:9:7 What soldier ever serves at his own expense ? Who plants a vineyard , and doesn't eat of its fruit ? Or who feeds a flock , and doesn't drink from the flock's milk ? 

$ 6:9:8 Do I speak these things according to the ways of men ? Or doesn't the law also say the same thing ? 

$ 6:9:9 For it is written in the law of Moses , <" You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain . >" Is it for the oxen that God cares , 

$ 6:9:10 or does he say it assuredly for our sake ? Yes , it was written for our sake , because he who plows ought to plow in hope , and he who threshes in hope should partake of his hope . 

$ 6:9:11 If we sowed to you spiritual things , is it a great thing if we reap your fleshly things ? 

$ 6:9:12 If others partake of this right over you , don't we yet more ? Nevertheless we didn't use this right , but we bear all things , that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Christ . 

$ 6:9:13 Don't you know that those who serve around sacred things eat from the things of the temple , and those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar ? 

$ 6:9:14 Even so the Lord ordained that those who proclaim the Good News should live from the Good News . 

$ 6:9:15 But I have used none of these things , and I don't write these things that it may be done so in my case ; for I would rather die , than that anyone should make my boasting void . 

$ 6:9:16 For if I preach the Good News , I have nothing to boast about ; for necessity is laid on me ; but woe is to me if I don't preach the Good News . 

$ 6:9:17 For if I do this of my own will , I have a reward . But if not of my own will , I have a stewardship entrusted to me . 

$ 6:9:18 What then is my reward ? That when I preach the Good News , I may present the Good News of Christ without charge , so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News . 

$ 6:9:19 For though I was free from all , I brought myself under bondage to all , that I might gain the more . 

$ 6:9:20 To the Jews I became as a Jew , that I might gain Jews ; to those who are under the law , as under the law , that I might gain those who are under the law ; 

$ 6:9:21 to those who are without law , as without law ( not being without law toward God , but under law toward Christ ) , that I might win those who are without law . 

$ 6:9:22 To the weak I became as weak , that I might gain the weak . I have become all things to all men , that I may by all means save some . 

$ 6:9:23 Now I do this for the sake of the Good News , that I may be a joint partaker of it . 

$ 6:9:24 Don't you know that those who run in a race all run , but one receives the prize ? Run like that , that you may win . 

$ 6:9:25 Every man who strives in the games exercises self - control in all things . Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown , but we an incorruptible . 

$ 6:9:26 I therefore run like that , not aimlessly . I fight like that , not beating the air , 

$ 6:9:27 but I beat my body and bring it into submission , lest by any means , after I have preached to others , I myself should be rejected . 


$ 6:10:1 Now I would not have you ignorant , brothers , that our fathers were all under the cloud , and all passed through the sea ; 

$ 6:10:2 and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea ; 

$ 6:10:3 and all ate the same spiritual food ; 

$ 6:10:4 and all drank the same spiritual drink . For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them , and the rock was Christ . 

$ 6:10:5 However with most of them , God was not well pleased , for they were overthrown in the wilderness . 

$ 6:10:6 Now these things were our examples , to the intent we should not lust after evil things , as they also lusted . 

$ 6:10:7 Don't be idolaters , as some of them were . As it is written , <" The people sat down to eat and drink , and rose up to play . >" 

$ 6:10:8 Let's not commit sexual immorality , as some of them committed , and in one day twenty - three thousand fell . 

$ 6:10:9 Let's not test Christ , as some of them tested , and perished by the serpents . 

$ 6:10:10 Don't grumble , as some of them also grumbled , and perished by the destroyer . 

$ 6:10:11 Now all these things happened to them by way of example , and they were written for our admonition , on whom the ends of the ages have come . 

$ 6:10:12 Therefore let him who thinks he stands be careful that he doesn't fall . 

$ 6:10:13 No temptation has taken you except what is common to man . God is faithful , who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able , but will with the temptation also make the way of escape , that you may be able to endure it . 

$ 6:10:14 Therefore , my beloved , flee from idolatry . 

$ 6:10:15 I speak as to wise men . Judge what I say . 

$ 6:10:16 The cup of blessing which we bless , isn't it a sharing of the blood of Christ ? The bread which we break , isn't it a sharing of the body of Christ ? 

$ 6:10:17 Because there is one loaf of bread , we , who are many , are one body ; for we all partake of the one loaf of bread . 

$ 6:10:18 Consider Israel according to the flesh . Don't those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar ? 

$ 6:10:19 What am I saying then ? That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything , or that an idol is anything ? 

$ 6:10:20 But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to demons , and not to God , and I don't desire that you would have fellowship with demons . 

$ 6:10:21 You can't both drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons . You can't both partake of the table of the Lord and of the table of demons . 

$ 6:10:22 Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? Are we stronger than he ? 

$ 6:10:23 <" All things are lawful for me , >" but not all things are profitable . <" All things are lawful for me , >" but not all things build up . 

$ 6:10:24 Let no one seek his own , but each one his neighbor's good . 

$ 6:10:25 Whatever is sold in the butcher shop , eat , asking no question for the sake of conscience , 

$ 6:10:26 for <" the earth is the Lord's , and its fullness . >" 

$ 6:10:27 But if one of those who don't believe invites you to a meal , and you are inclined to go , eat whatever is set before you , asking no questions for the sake of conscience . 

$ 6:10:28 But if anyone says to you , <" This was offered to idols , >" don't eat it for the sake of the one who told you , and for the sake of conscience . For <" the earth is the Lord's , with all its fullness . >" 

$ 6:10:29 Conscience , I say , not your own , but the other's conscience . For why is my liberty judged by another conscience ? 

$ 6:10:30 If I partake with thankfulness , why am I denounced for something I give thanks for ? 

$ 6:10:31 Whether therefore you eat , or drink , or whatever you do , do all to the glory of God . 

$ 6:10:32 Give no occasion for stumbling , whether to Jews , or to Greeks , or to the assembly of God ; 

$ 6:10:33 even as I also please all men in all things , not seeking my own profit , but the profit of the many , that they may be saved . 


$ 6:11:1 Be imitators of me , even as I also am of Christ . 

$ 6:11:2 Now I praise you , brothers , that you remember me in all things , and hold firm the traditions , even as I delivered them to you . 

$ 6:11:3 But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ , and the head of the woman is man , and the head of Christ is God . 

$ 6:11:4 Every man praying or prophesying , having his head covered , dishonors his head . 

$ 6:11:5 But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered dishonors her head . For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved . 

$ 6:11:6 For if a woman is not covered , let her hair also be cut off . But if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or be shaved , let her be covered . 

$ 6:11:7 For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered , because he is the image and glory of God , but the woman is the glory of the man . 

$ 6:11:8 For man is not from woman , but woman from man ; 

$ 6:11:9 for man wasn't created for the woman , but woman for the man . 

$ 6:11:10 For this cause the woman ought to have authority over her own head , because of the angels . 

$ 6:11:11 Nevertheless , neither is the woman independent of the man , nor the man independent of the woman , in the Lord . 

$ 6:11:12 For as woman came from man , so a man also comes through a woman ; but all things are from God . 

$ 6:11:13 Judge for yourselves . Is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled ? 

$ 6:11:14 Doesn't even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair , it is a dishonor to him ? 

$ 6:11:15 But if a woman has long hair , it is a glory to her , for her hair is given to her for a covering . 

$ 6:11:16 But if any man seems to be contentious , we have no such custom , neither do God's assemblies . 

$ 6:11:17 But in giving you this command , I don't praise you , that you come together not for the better but for the worse . 

$ 6:11:18 For first of all , when you come together in the assembly , I hear that divisions exist among you , and I partly believe it . 

$ 6:11:19 For there also must be factions among you , that those who are approved may be revealed among you . 

$ 6:11:20 When therefore you assemble yourselves together , it is not the Lord's supper that you eat . 

$ 6:11:21 For in your eating each one takes his own supper first . One is hungry , and another is drunken . 

$ 6:11:22 What , don't you have houses to eat and to drink in ? Or do you despise God's assembly and put them to shame who don't have enough ? What shall I tell you ? Shall I praise you ? In this I don't praise you . 

$ 6:11:23 For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you , that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread . 

$ 6:11:24 When he had given thanks , he broke it and said , \ <" Take , eat . This is my body , which is broken for you . Do this in memory of me . >" /  

$ 6:11:25 In the same way he also took the cup , after supper , saying , \ <" This cup is the new covenant in my blood . Do this , as often as you drink , in memory of me . >" /  

$ 6:11:26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup , you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes . 

$ 6:11:27 Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord's cup in a way unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord . 

$ 6:11:28 But let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of the bread , and drink of the cup . 

$ 6:11:29 For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy way eats and drinks judgment to himself if he doesn't discern the Lord's body . 

$ 6:11:30 For this cause many among you are weak and sickly , and not a few sleep . 

$ 6:11:31 For if we discerned ourselves , we wouldn't be judged . 

$ 6:11:32 But when we are judged , we are punished by the Lord , that we may not be condemned with the world . 

$ 6:11:33 Therefore , my brothers , when you come together to eat , wait for one another . 

$ 6:11:34 But if anyone is hungry , let him eat at home , lest your coming together be for judgment . The rest I will set in order whenever I come . 


$ 6:12:1 Now concerning spiritual things , brothers , I don't want you to be ignorant . 

$ 6:12:2 You know that when you were heathen , you were led away to those mute idols , however you might be led . 

$ 6:12:3 Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God's Spirit says , <" Jesus is accursed . >" No one can say , <" Jesus is Lord , >" but by the Holy Spirit . 

$ 6:12:4 Now there are various kinds of gifts , but the same Spirit . 

$ 6:12:5 There are various kinds of service , and the same Lord . 

$ 6:12:6 There are various kinds of workings , but the same God , who works all things in all . 

$ 6:12:7 But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all . 

$ 6:12:8 For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom , and to another the word of knowledge , according to the same Spirit ; 

$ 6:12:9 to another faith , by the same Spirit ; and to another gifts of healings , by the same Spirit ; 

$ 6:12:10 and to another workings of miracles ; and to another prophecy ; and to another discerning of spirits ; to another different kinds of languages ; and to another the interpretation of languages . 

$ 6:12:11 But the one and the same Spirit produces all of these , distributing to each one separately as he desires . 

$ 6:12:12 For as the body is one , and has many members , and all the members of the body , being many , are one body ; so also is Christ . 

$ 6:12:13 For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body , whether Jews or Greeks , whether bond or free ; and were all given to drink into one Spirit . 

$ 6:12:14 For the body is not one member , but many . 

$ 6:12:15 If the foot would say , <" Because I'm not the hand , I'm not part of the body , >" it is not therefore not part of the body . 

$ 6:12:16 If the ear would say , <" Because I'm not the eye , I'm not part of the body , >" it's not therefore not part of the body . 

$ 6:12:17 If the whole body were an eye , where would the hearing be ? If the whole were hearing , where would the smelling be ? 

$ 6:12:18 But now God has set the members , each one of them , in the body , just as he desired . 

$ 6:12:19 If they were all one member , where would the body be ? 

$ 6:12:20 But now they are many members , but one body . 

$ 6:12:21 The eye can't tell the hand , <" I have no need for you , >" or again the head to the feet , <" I have no need for you . >" 

$ 6:12:22 No , much rather , those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary . 

$ 6:12:23 Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable , on those we bestow more abundant honor ; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety ; 

$ 6:12:24 whereas our presentable parts have no such need . But God composed the body together , giving more abundant honor to the inferior part , 

$ 6:12:25 that there should be no division in the body , but that the members should have the same care for one another . 

$ 6:12:26 When one member suffers , all the members suffer with it . When one member is honored , all the members rejoice with it . 

$ 6:12:27 Now you are the body of Christ , and members individually . 

$ 6:12:28 God has set some in the assembly : first apostles , second prophets , third teachers , then miracle workers , then gifts of healings , helps , governments , and various kinds of languages . 

$ 6:12:29 Are all apostles ? Are all prophets ? Are all teachers ? Are all miracle workers ? 

$ 6:12:30 Do all have gifts of healings ? Do all speak with various languages ? Do all interpret ? 

$ 6:12:31 But earnestly desire the best gifts . Moreover , I show a most excellent way to you . 


$ 6:13:1 If I speak with the languages of men and of angels , but don't have love , I have become sounding brass , or a clanging cymbal . 

$ 6:13:2 If I have the gift of prophecy , and know all mysteries and all knowledge ; and if I have all faith , so as to remove mountains , but don't have love , I am nothing . 

$ 6:13:3 If I give away all my goods to feed the poor , and if I give my body to be burned , but don't have love , it profits me nothing . 

$ 6:13:4 Love is patient and is kind . Love doesn't envy . Love doesn't brag , is not proud , 

$ 6:13:5 doesn't behave itself inappropriately , doesn't seek its own way , is not provoked , takes no account of evil ; 

$ 6:13:6 doesn't rejoice in unrighteousness , but rejoices with the truth ; 

$ 6:13:7 bears all things , believes all things , hopes all things , and endures all things . 

$ 6:13:8 Love never fails . But where there are prophecies , they will be done away with . Where there are various languages , they will cease . Where there is knowledge , it will be done away with . 

$ 6:13:9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part ; 

$ 6:13:10 but when that which is complete has come , then that which is partial will be done away with . 

$ 6:13:11 When I was a child , I spoke as a child , I felt as a child , I thought as a child . Now that I have become a man , I have put away childish things . 

$ 6:13:12 For now we see in a mirror , dimly , but then face to face . Now I know in part , but then I will know fully , even as I was also fully known . 

$ 6:13:13 But now faith , hope , and love remain - these three . The greatest of these is love . 


$ 6:14:1 Follow after love and earnestly desire spiritual gifts , but especially that you may prophesy . 

$ 6:14:2 For he who speaks in another language speaks not to men , but to God ; for no one understands ; but in the Spirit he speaks mysteries . 

$ 6:14:3 But he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification , exhortation , and consolation . 

$ 6:14:4 He who speaks in another language edifies himself , but he who prophesies edifies the assembly . 

$ 6:14:5 Now I desire to have you all speak with other languages , but rather that you would prophesy . For he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages , unless he interprets , that the assembly may be built up . 

$ 6:14:6 But now , brothers , if I come to you speaking with other languages , what would I profit you , unless I speak to you either by way of revelation , or of knowledge , or of prophesying , or of teaching ? 

$ 6:14:7 Even things without life , giving a voice , whether pipe or harp , if they didn't give a distinction in the sounds , how would it be known what is piped or harped ? 

$ 6:14:8 For if the trumpet gave an uncertain sound , who would prepare himself for war ? 

$ 6:14:9 So also you , unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand , how would it be known what is spoken ? For you would be speaking into the air . 

$ 6:14:10 There are , it may be , so many kinds of sounds in the world , and none of them is without meaning . 

$ 6:14:11 If then I don't know the meaning of the sound , I would be to him who speaks a foreigner , and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me . 

$ 6:14:12 So also you , since you are zealous for spiritual gifts , seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly . 

$ 6:14:13 Therefore let him who speaks in another language pray that he may interpret . 

$ 6:14:14 For if I pray in another language , my spirit prays , but my understanding is unfruitful . 

$ 6:14:15 What is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , and I will pray with the understanding also . I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also . 

$ 6:14:16 Otherwise if you bless with the spirit , how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the <" Amen >" at your giving of thanks , seeing he doesn't know what you say ? 

$ 6:14:17 For you most certainly give thanks well , but the other person is not built up . 

$ 6:14:18 I thank my God , I speak with other languages more than you all . 

$ 6:14:19 However in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding , that I might instruct others also , than ten thousand words in another language . 

$ 6:14:20 Brothers , don't be children in thoughts , yet in malice be babies , but in thoughts be mature . 

$ 6:14:21 In the law it is written , <" By men of strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people . They won't even hear me that way , says the Lord . >" 

$ 6:14:22 Therefore other languages are for a sign , not to those who believe , but to the unbelieving ; but prophesying is for a sign , not to the unbelieving , but to those who believe . 

$ 6:14:23 If therefore the whole assembly is assembled together and all speak with other languages , and unlearned or unbelieving people come in , won't they say that you are crazy ? 

$ 6:14:24 But if all prophesy , and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in , he is reproved by all , and he is judged by all . 

$ 6:14:25 And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed . So he will fall down on his face and worship God , declaring that God is among you indeed . 

$ 6:14:26 What is it then , brothers ? When you come together , each one of you has a psalm , has a teaching , has a revelation , has another language , or has an interpretation . Let all things be done to build each other up . 

$ 6:14:27 If any man speaks in another language , let it be two , or at the most three , and in turn ; and let one interpret . 

$ 6:14:28 But if there is no interpreter , let him keep silent in the assembly , and let him speak to himself , and to God . 

$ 6:14:29 Let the prophets speak , two or three , and let the others discern . 

$ 6:14:30 But if a revelation is made to another sitting by , let the first keep silent . 

$ 6:14:31 For you all can prophesy one by one , that all may learn , and all may be exhorted . 

$ 6:14:32 The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets , 

$ 6:14:33 for God is not a God of confusion , but of peace , as in all the assemblies of the saints . 

$ 6:14:34 Let the wives be quiet in the assemblies , for it has not been permitted for them to be talking except in submission , as the law also says , 

$ 6:14:35 if they desire to learn anything . <" Let them ask their own husbands at home , for it is shameful for a wife to be talking in the assembly . >" 

$ 6:14:36 What ! ? Was it from you that the word of God went out ? Or did it come to you alone ? 

$ 6:14:37 If any man thinks himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him recognize the things which I write to you , that they are the commandment of the Lord . 

$ 6:14:38 But if anyone is ignorant , let him be ignorant . 

$ 6:14:39 Therefore , brothers , desire earnestly to prophesy , and don't forbid speaking with other languages . 

$ 6:14:40 Let all things be done decently and in order . 


$ 6:15:1 Now I declare to you , brothers , the Good News which I preached to you , which also you received , in which you also stand , 

$ 6:15:2 by which also you are saved , if you hold firmly the word which I preached to you - unless you believed in vain . 

$ 6:15:3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received : that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures , 

$ 6:15:4 that he was buried , that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures , 

$ 6:15:5 and that he appeared to Cephas , then to the twelve . 

$ 6:15:6 Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers at once , most of whom remain until now , but some have also fallen asleep . 

$ 6:15:7 Then he appeared to James , then to all the apostles , 

$ 6:15:8 and last of all , as to the child born at the wrong time , he appeared to me also . 

$ 6:15:9 For I am the least of the apostles , who is not worthy to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the assembly of God . 

$ 6:15:10 But by the grace of God I am what I am . His grace which was given to me was not futile , but I worked more than all of them ; yet not I , but the grace of God which was with me . 

$ 6:15:11 Whether then it is I or they , so we preach , and so you believed . 

$ 6:15:12 Now if Christ is preached , that he has been raised from the dead , how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ? 

$ 6:15:13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead , neither has Christ been raised . 

$ 6:15:14 If Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is in vain , and your faith also is in vain . 

$ 6:15:15 Yes , we are also found false witnesses of God , because we testified about God that he raised up Christ , whom he didn't raise up , if it is so that the dead are not raised . 

$ 6:15:16 For if the dead aren't raised , neither has Christ been raised . 

$ 6:15:17 If Christ has not been raised , your faith is vain ; you are still in your sins . 

$ 6:15:18 Then they also who are fallen asleep in Christ have perished . 

$ 6:15:19 If we have only hoped in Christ in this life , we are of all men most pitiable . 

$ 6:15:20 But now Christ has been raised from the dead . He became the first fruits of those who are asleep . 

$ 6:15:21 For since death came by man , the resurrection of the dead also came by man . 

$ 6:15:22 For as in Adam all die , so also in Christ all will be made alive . 

$ 6:15:23 But each in his own order : Christ the first fruits , then those who are Christ's , at his coming . 

$ 6:15:24 Then the end comes , when he will deliver up the Kingdom to God , even the Father , when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power . 

$ 6:15:25 For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet . 

$ 6:15:26 The last enemy that will be abolished is death . 

$ 6:15:27 For , <" He put all things in subjection under his feet . >" But when he says , <" All things are put in subjection >" , it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him . 

$ 6:15:28 When all things have been subjected to him , then the Son will also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him , that God may be all in all . 

$ 6:15:29 Or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead ? If the dead aren't raised at all , why then are they baptized for the dead ? 

$ 6:15:30 Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour ? 

$ 6:15:31 I affirm , by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord , I die daily . 

$ 6:15:32 If I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes , what does it profit me ? If the dead are not raised , then <" let's eat and drink , for tomorrow we die . >" 

$ 6:15:33 Don't be deceived ! <" Evil companionships corrupt good morals . >" 

$ 6:15:34 Wake up righteously , and don't sin , for some have no knowledge of God . I say this to your shame . 

$ 6:15:35 But someone will say , <" How are the dead raised ? >" and , <" With what kind of body do they come ? >" 

$ 6:15:36 You foolish one , that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies . 

$ 6:15:37 That which you sow , you don't sow the body that will be , but a bare grain , maybe of wheat , or of some other kind . 

$ 6:15:38 But God gives it a body even as it pleased him , and to each seed a body of its own . 

$ 6:15:39 All flesh is not the same flesh , but there is one flesh of men , another flesh of animals , another of fish , and another of birds . 

$ 6:15:40 There are also celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies ; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial . 

$ 6:15:41 There is one glory of the sun , another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars ; for one star differs from another star in glory . 

$ 6:15:42 So also is the resurrection of the dead . The body is sown perishable ; it is raised imperishable . 

$ 6:15:43 It is sown in dishonor ; it is raised in glory . It is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power . 

$ 6:15:44 It is sown a natural body ; it is raised a spiritual body . There is a natural body and there is also a spiritual body . 

$ 6:15:45 So also it is written , <" The first man , Adam , became a living soul . >" The last Adam became a life - giving spirit . 

$ 6:15:46 However that which is spiritual isn't first , but that which is natural , then that which is spiritual . 

$ 6:15:47 The first man is of the earth , made of dust . The second man is the Lord from heaven . 

$ 6:15:48 As is the one made of dust , such are those who are also made of dust ; and as is the heavenly , such are they also that are heavenly . 

$ 6:15:49 As we have borne the image of those made of dust , let's also bear the image of the heavenly . 

$ 6:15:50 Now I say this , brothers , that flesh and blood can't inherit God's Kingdom ; neither does the perishable inherit imperishable . 

$ 6:15:51 Behold , I tell you a mystery . We will not all sleep , but we will all be changed , 

$ 6:15:52 in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trumpet . For the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised incorruptible , and we will be changed . 

$ 6:15:53 For this perishable body must become imperishable , and this mortal must put on immortality . 

$ 6:15:54 But when this perishable body will have become imperishable , and this mortal will have put on immortality , then what is written will happen : <" Death is swallowed up in victory . >" 

$ 6:15:55 <" Death , where is your sting ? Hades , where is your victory ? >" 

$ 6:15:56 The sting of death is sin , and the power of sin is the law . 

$ 6:15:57 But thanks be to God , who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ . 

$ 6:15:58 Therefore , my beloved brothers , be steadfast , immovable , always abounding in the Lord's work , because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord . 


$ 6:16:1 Now concerning the collection for the saints , as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia , you do likewise . 

$ 6:16:2 On the first day of every week , let each one of you save , as he may prosper , that no collections are made when I come . 

$ 6:16:3 When I arrive , I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem . 

$ 6:16:4 If it is appropriate for me to go also , they will go with me . 

$ 6:16:5 But I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia , for I am passing through Macedonia . 

$ 6:16:6 But with you it may be that I will stay , or even winter , that you may send me on my journey wherever I go . 

$ 6:16:7 For I do not wish to see you now in passing , but I hope to stay a while with you , if the Lord permits . 

$ 6:16:8 But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost , 

$ 6:16:9 for a great and effective door has opened to me , and there are many adversaries . 

$ 6:16:10 Now if Timothy comes , see that he is with you without fear , for he does the work of the Lord , as I also do . 

$ 6:16:11 Therefore let no one despise him . But set him forward on his journey in peace , that he may come to me ; for I expect him with the brothers . 

$ 6:16:12 Now concerning Apollos , the brother , I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers ; and it was not at all his desire to come now ; but he will come when he has an opportunity . 

$ 6:16:13 Watch ! Stand firm in the faith ! Be courageous ! Be strong ! 

$ 6:16:14 Let all that you do be done in love . 

$ 6:16:15 Now I beg you , brothers - you know the house of Stephanas , that it is the first fruits of Achaia , and that they have set themselves to serve the saints - 

$ 6:16:16 that you also be in subjection to such , and to everyone who helps in the work and labors . 

$ 6:16:17 I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas , Fortunatus , and Achaicus ; for that which was lacking on your part , they supplied . 

$ 6:16:18 For they refreshed my spirit and yours . Therefore acknowledge those who are like that . 

$ 6:16:19 The assemblies of Asia greet you . Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord , together with the assembly that is in their house . 

$ 6:16:20 All the brothers greet you . Greet one another with a holy kiss . 

$ 6:16:21 This greeting is by me , Paul , with my own hand . 

$ 6:16:22 If any man doesn't love the Lord Jesus Christ , let him be cursed . Come , Lord ! 

$ 6:16:23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you . 

$ 6:16:24 My love to all of you in Christ Jesus . Amen .
