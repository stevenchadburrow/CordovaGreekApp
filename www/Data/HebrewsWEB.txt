$ 18:1:1 God , having in the past spoken to the fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways , 

$ 18:1:2 has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son , whom he appointed heir of all things , through whom also he made the worlds . 

$ 18:1:3 His Son is the radiance of his glory , the very image of his substance , and upholding all things by the word of his power , who , when he had by himself purified us of our sins , sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high ; 

$ 18:1:4 having become so much better than the angels , as he has inherited a more excellent name than they have . 

$ 18:1:5 For to which of the angels did he say at any time , <" You are my Son . Today I have become your father ? >" <" I will be to him a Father , and he will be to me a Son ? >" 

$ 18:1:6 When he again brings in the firstborn into the world he says , <" Let all the angels of God worship him . >" 

$ 18:1:7 Of the angels he says , <" Who makes his angels winds , and his servants a flame of fire . >" 

$ 18:1:8 But of the Son he says , <" Your throne , O God , is forever and ever . The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom . 

$ 18:1:9 You have loved righteousness , and hated iniquity ; therefore God , your God , has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows . >" 

$ 18:1:10 And , <" You , Lord , in the beginning , laid the foundation of the earth . The heavens are the works of your hands . 

$ 18:1:11 They will perish , but you continue . They all will grow old like a garment does . 

$ 18:1:12 You will roll them up like a mantle , and they will be changed ; but you are the same . Your years will not fail . >" 

$ 18:1:13 But which of the angels has he told at any time , <" Sit at my right hand , until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet ? >" 

$ 18:1:14 Aren't they all serving spirits , sent out to do service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation ? 


$ 18:2:1 Therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that were heard , lest perhaps we drift away . 

$ 18:2:2 For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast , and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense ; 

$ 18:2:3 how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation - which at the first having been spoken through the Lord , was confirmed to us by those who heard ; 

$ 18:2:4 God also testifying with them , both by signs and wonders , by various works of power , and by gifts of the Holy Spirit , according to his own will ? 

$ 18:2:5 For he didn't subject the world to come , of which we speak , to angels . 

$ 18:2:6 But one has somewhere testified , saying , <" What is man , that you think of him ? Or the son of man , that you care for him ? 

$ 18:2:7 You made him a little lower than the angels . You crowned him with glory and honor . 

$ 18:2:8 You have put all things in subjection under his feet . >" For in that he subjected all things to him , he left nothing that is not subject to him . But now we don't see all things subjected to him , yet . 

$ 18:2:9 But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels , Jesus , because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor , that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone . 

$ 18:2:10 For it became him , for whom are all things , and through whom are all things , in bringing many children to glory , to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings . 

$ 18:2:11 For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one , for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers , 

$ 18:2:12 saying , <" I will declare your name to my brothers . Among the congregation I will sing your praise . >" 

$ 18:2:13 Again , <" I will put my trust in him . >" Again , <" Behold , here I am with the children whom God has given me . >" 

$ 18:2:14 Since then the children have shared in flesh and blood , he also himself in the same way partook of the same , that through death he might bring to nothing him who had the power of death , that is , the devil , 

$ 18:2:15 and might deliver all of them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage . 

$ 18:2:16 For most certainly , he doesn't give help to angels , but he gives help to the offspring of Abraham . 

$ 18:2:17 Therefore he was obligated in all things to be made like his brothers , that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God , to make atonement for the sins of the people . 

$ 18:2:18 For in that he himself has suffered being tempted , he is able to help those who are tempted . 


$ 18:3:1 Therefore , holy brothers , partakers of a heavenly calling , consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession , Jesus ; 

$ 18:3:2 who was faithful to him who appointed him , as also was Moses in all his house . 

$ 18:3:3 For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses , because he who built the house has more honor than the house . 

$ 18:3:4 For every house is built by someone ; but he who built all things is God . 

$ 18:3:5 Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant , for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken , 

$ 18:3:6 but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house ; whose house we are , if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end . 

$ 18:3:7 Therefore , even as the Holy Spirit says , <" Today if you will hear his voice , 

$ 18:3:8 don't harden your hearts , as in the rebellion , like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness , 

$ 18:3:9 where your fathers tested me by proving me , and saw my deeds for forty years . 

$ 18:3:10 Therefore I was displeased with that generation , and said , <' They always err in their heart , but they didn't know my ways ; >' 

$ 18:3:11 as I swore in my wrath , <' They will not enter into my rest . >' >" 

$ 18:3:12 Beware , brothers , lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief , in falling away from the living God ; 

$ 18:3:13 but exhort one another day by day , so long as it is called <" today >" ; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin . 

$ 18:3:14 For we have become partakers of Christ , if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end : 

$ 18:3:15 while it is said , <" Today if you will hear his voice , don't harden your hearts , as in the rebellion . >" 

$ 18:3:16 For who , when they heard , rebelled ? No , didn't all those who came out of Egypt by Moses ? 

$ 18:3:17 With whom was he displeased forty years ? Wasn't it with those who sinned , whose bodies fell in the wilderness ? 

$ 18:3:18 To whom did he swear that they wouldn't enter into his rest , but to those who were disobedient ? 

$ 18:3:19 We see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief . 


$ 18:4:1 Let's fear therefore , lest perhaps anyone of you should seem to have come short of a promise of entering into his rest . 

$ 18:4:2 For indeed we have had good news preached to us , even as they also did , but the word they heard didn't profit them , because it wasn't mixed with faith by those who heard . 

$ 18:4:3 For we who have believed do enter into that rest , even as he has said , <" As I swore in my wrath , they will not enter into my rest ; >" although the works were finished from the foundation of the world . 

$ 18:4:4 For he has said this somewhere about the seventh day , <" God rested on the seventh day from all his works ; >" 

$ 18:4:5 and in this place again , <" They will not enter into my rest . >" 

$ 18:4:6 Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter into it , and they to whom the good news was preached before failed to enter in because of disobedience , 

$ 18:4:7 he again defines a certain day , today , saying through David so long a time afterward ( just as has been said ) , <" Today if you will hear his voice , don't harden your hearts . >" 

$ 18:4:8 For if Joshua had given them rest , he would not have spoken afterward of another day . 

$ 18:4:9 There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God . 

$ 18:4:10 For he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works , as God did from his . 

$ 18:4:11 Let's therefore give diligence to enter into that rest , lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience . 

$ 18:4:12 For the word of God is living and active , and sharper than any two - edged sword , piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit , of both joints and marrow , and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart . 

$ 18:4:13 There is no creature that is hidden from his sight , but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him to whom we must give an account . 

$ 18:4:14 Having then a great high priest , who has passed through the heavens , Jesus , the Son of God , let's hold tightly to our confession . 

$ 18:4:15 For we don't have a high priest who can't be touched with the feeling of our infirmities , but one who has been in all points tempted like we are , yet without sin . 

$ 18:4:16 Let's therefore draw near with boldness to the throne of grace , that we may receive mercy , and may find grace for help in time of need . 


$ 18:5:1 For every high priest , being taken from among men , is appointed for men in things pertaining to God , that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins . 

$ 18:5:2 The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray , because he himself is also surrounded with weakness . 

$ 18:5:3 Because of this , he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people , as well as for himself . 

$ 18:5:4 Nobody takes this honor on himself , but he is called by God , just like Aaron was . 

$ 18:5:5 So also Christ didn't glorify himself to be made a high priest , but it was he who said to him , <" You are my Son . Today I have become your father . >" 

$ 18:5:6 As he says also in another place , <" You are a priest forever , after the order of Melchizedek . >" 

$ 18:5:7 He , in the days of his flesh , having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death , and having been heard for his godly fear , 

$ 18:5:8 though he was a Son , yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered . 

$ 18:5:9 Having been made perfect , he became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation , 

$ 18:5:10 named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek . 

$ 18:5:11 About him we have many words to say , and hard to interpret , seeing you have become dull of hearing . 

$ 18:5:12 For although by this time you should be teachers , you again need to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the revelations of God . You have come to need milk , and not solid food . 

$ 18:5:13 For everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness , for he is a baby . 

$ 18:5:14 But solid food is for those who are full grown , who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil . 


$ 18:6:1 Therefore leaving the teaching of the first principles of Christ , let's press on to perfection - not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works , of faith toward God , 

$ 18:6:2 of the teaching of baptisms , of laying on of hands , of resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment . 

$ 18:6:3 This will we do , if God permits . 

$ 18:6:4 For concerning those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift , and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit , 

$ 18:6:5 and tasted the good word of God , and the powers of the age to come , 

$ 18:6:6 and then fell away , it is impossible to renew them again to repentance ; seeing they crucify the Son of God for themselves again , and put him to open shame . 

$ 18:6:7 For the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it , and produces a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled , receives blessing from God ; 

$ 18:6:8 but if it bears thorns and thistles , it is rejected and near being cursed , whose end is to be burned . 

$ 18:6:9 But , beloved , we are persuaded of better things for you , and things that accompany salvation , even though we speak like this . 

$ 18:6:10 For God is not unrighteous , so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name , in that you served the saints , and still do serve them . 

$ 18:6:11 We desire that each one of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end , 

$ 18:6:12 that you won't be sluggish , but imitators of those who through faith and perseverance inherited the promises . 

$ 18:6:13 For when God made a promise to Abraham , since he could swear by no one greater , he swore by himself , 

$ 18:6:14 saying , <" Surely blessing I will bless you , and multiplying I will multiply you . >" 

$ 18:6:15 Thus , having patiently endured , he obtained the promise . 

$ 18:6:16 For men indeed swear by a greater one , and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation . 

$ 18:6:17 In this way God , being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel , interposed with an oath ; 

$ 18:6:18 that by two immutable things , in which it is impossible for God to lie , we may have a strong encouragement , who have fled for refuge to take hold of the hope set before us . 

$ 18:6:19 This hope we have as an anchor of the soul , a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil ; 

$ 18:6:20 where as a forerunner Jesus entered for us , having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek . 


$ 18:7:1 For this Melchizedek , king of Salem , priest of God Most High , who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him , 

$ 18:7:2 to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all ( being first , by interpretation , <" king of righteousness >" , and then also <" king of Salem >" , which means <" king of peace >" ; 

$ 18:7:3 without father , without mother , without genealogy , having neither beginning of days nor end of life , but made like the Son of God ) , remains a priest continually . 

$ 18:7:4 Now consider how great this man was , to whom even Abraham , the patriarch , gave a tenth out of the best plunder . 

$ 18:7:5 They indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest's office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law , that is , of their brothers , though these have come out of the body of Abraham , 

$ 18:7:6 but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has accepted tithes from Abraham , and has blessed him who has the promises . 

$ 18:7:7 But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater . 

$ 18:7:8 Here people who die receive tithes , but there one receives tithes of whom it is testified that he lives . 

$ 18:7:9 We can say that through Abraham even Levi , who receives tithes , has paid tithes , 

$ 18:7:10 for he was yet in the body of his father when Melchizedek met him . 

$ 18:7:11 Now perfection was through the Levitical priesthood ( for under it the people have received the law ) , what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek , and not be called after the order of Aaron ? 

$ 18:7:12 For the priesthood being changed , there is of necessity a change made also in the law . 

$ 18:7:13 For he of whom these things are said belongs to another tribe , from which no one has officiated at the altar . 

$ 18:7:14 For it is evident that our Lord has sprung out of Judah , about which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood . 

$ 18:7:15 This is yet more abundantly evident , if after the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another priest , 

$ 18:7:16 who has been made , not after the law of a fleshly commandment , but after the power of an endless life : 

$ 18:7:17 for it is testified , <" You are a priest forever , according to the order of Melchizedek . >" 

$ 18:7:18 For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because of its weakness and uselessness 

$ 18:7:19 ( for the law made nothing perfect ) , and a bringing in of a better hope , through which we draw near to God . 

$ 18:7:20 Inasmuch as he was not made priest without the taking of an oath 

$ 18:7:21 ( for they indeed have been made priests without an oath ) , but he with an oath by him that says of him , <" The Lord swore and will not change his mind , <' You are a priest forever , according to the order of Melchizedek . >' >" 

$ 18:7:22 By so much , Jesus has become the collateral of a better covenant . 

$ 18:7:23 Many , indeed , have been made priests , because they are hindered from continuing by death . 

$ 18:7:24 But he , because he lives forever , has his priesthood unchangeable . 

$ 18:7:25 Therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him , seeing that he lives forever to make intercession for them . 

$ 18:7:26 For such a high priest was fitting for us : holy , guiltless , undefiled , separated from sinners , and made higher than the heavens ; 

$ 18:7:27 who doesn't need , like those high priests , to offer up sacrifices daily , first for his own sins , and then for the sins of the people . For he did this once for all , when he offered up himself . 

$ 18:7:28 For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness , but the word of the oath which came after the law appoints a Son forever who has been perfected . 


$ 18:8:1 Now in the things which we are saying , the main point is this . We have such a high priest , who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens , 

$ 18:8:2 a servant of the sanctuary , and of the true tabernacle , which the Lord pitched , not man . 

$ 18:8:3 For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices . Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer . 

$ 18:8:4 For if he were on earth , he would not be a priest at all , seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law ; 

$ 18:8:5 who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things , even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle , for he said , <" See , you shall make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain . >" 

$ 18:8:6 But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry , by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant , which on better promises has been given as law . 

$ 18:8:7 For if that first covenant had been faultless , then no place would have been sought for a second . 

$ 18:8:8 For finding fault with them , he said , <" Behold , the days come >" , says the Lord , <" that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah ; 

$ 18:8:9 not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers , in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt ; for they didn't continue in my covenant , and I disregarded them , >" says the Lord . 

$ 18:8:10 <" For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel . After those days , >" says the Lord ; <" I will put my laws into their mind , I will also write them on their heart . I will be their God , and they will be my people . 

$ 18:8:11 They will not teach every man his fellow citizen , and every man his brother , saying , <' Know the Lord , >' for all will know me , from their least to their greatest . 

$ 18:8:12 For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness . I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no more . >" 

$ 18:8:13 In that he says , <" A new covenant >" , he has made the first old . But that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away . 


$ 18:9:1 Now indeed even the first covenant had ordinances of divine service , and an earthly sanctuary . 

$ 18:9:2 For a tabernacle was prepared . In the first part were the lamp stand , the table , and the show bread ; which is called the Holy Place . 

$ 18:9:3 After the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies , 

$ 18:9:4 having a golden altar of incense , and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold , in which was a golden pot holding the manna , Aaron's rod that budded , and the tablets of the covenant ; 

$ 18:9:5 and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat , of which things we can't speak now in detail . 

$ 18:9:6 Now these things having been thus prepared , the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle , accomplishing the services , 

$ 18:9:7 but into the second the high priest alone , once in the year , not without blood , which he offers for himself , and for the errors of the people . 

$ 18:9:8 The Holy Spirit is indicating this , that the way into the Holy Place wasn't yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing ; 

$ 18:9:9 which is a symbol of the present age , where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable , concerning the conscience , of making the worshiper perfect ; 

$ 18:9:10 being only ( with meats and drinks and various washings ) fleshly ordinances , imposed until a time of reformation . 

$ 18:9:11 But Christ having come as a high priest of the coming good things , through the greater and more perfect tabernacle , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this creation , 

$ 18:9:12 nor yet through the blood of goats and calves , but through his own blood , entered in once for all into the Holy Place , having obtained eternal redemption . 

$ 18:9:13 For if the blood of goats and bulls , and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled , sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh : 

$ 18:9:14 how much more will the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without defect to God , cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God ? 

$ 18:9:15 For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant , since a death has occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant , that those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance . 

$ 18:9:16 For where a last will and testament is , there must of necessity be the death of him who made it . 

$ 18:9:17 For a will is in force where there has been death , for it is never in force while he who made it lives . 

$ 18:9:18 Therefore even the first covenant has not been dedicated without blood . 

$ 18:9:19 For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of the calves and the goats , with water and scarlet wool and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people , 

$ 18:9:20 saying , <" This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you . >" 

$ 18:9:21 Moreover he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry in the same way with the blood . 

$ 18:9:22 According to the law , nearly everything is cleansed with blood , and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission . 

$ 18:9:23 It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these . 

$ 18:9:24 For Christ hasn't entered into holy places made with hands , which are representations of the true , but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us ; 

$ 18:9:25 nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own , 

$ 18:9:26 or else he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world . But now once at the end of the ages , he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself . 

$ 18:9:27 Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once , and after this , judgment , 

$ 18:9:28 so Christ also , having been offered once to bear the sins of many , will appear a second time , without sin , to those who are eagerly waiting for him for salvation . 


$ 18:10:1 For the law , having a shadow of the good to come , not the very image of the things , can never with the same sacrifices year by year , which they offer continually , make perfect those who draw near . 

$ 18:10:2 Or else wouldn't they have ceased to be offered , because the worshipers , having been once cleansed , would have had no more consciousness of sins ? 

$ 18:10:3 But in those sacrifices there is a yearly reminder of sins . 

$ 18:10:4 For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins . 

$ 18:10:5 Therefore when he comes into the world , he says , <" Sacrifice and offering you didn't desire , but you prepared a body for me . 

$ 18:10:6 You had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin . 

$ 18:10:7 Then I said , <' Behold , I have come ( in the scroll of the book it is written of me ) to do your will , O God . >' >" 

$ 18:10:8 Previously saying , <" Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you didn't desire , neither had pleasure in them >" ( those which are offered according to the law ) , 

$ 18:10:9 then he has said , <" Behold , I have come to do your will . >" He takes away the first , that he may establish the second , 

$ 18:10:10 by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all . 

$ 18:10:11 Every priest indeed stands day by day serving and often offering the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins , 

$ 18:10:12 but he , when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever , sat down on the right hand of God ; 

$ 18:10:13 from that time waiting until his enemies are made the footstool of his feet . 

$ 18:10:14 For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified . 

$ 18:10:15 The Holy Spirit also testifies to us , for after saying , 

$ 18:10:16 <" This is the covenant that I will make with them : <' After those days , >' says the Lord , <' I will put my laws on their heart , I will also write them on their mind ; >' >" then he says , 

$ 18:10:17 <" I will remember their sins and their iniquities no more . >" 

$ 18:10:18 Now where remission of these is , there is no more offering for sin . 

$ 18:10:19 Having therefore , brothers , boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus , 

$ 18:10:20 by the way which he dedicated for us , a new and living way , through the veil , that is to say , his flesh ; 

$ 18:10:21 and having a great priest over God's house , 

$ 18:10:22 let's draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and having our body washed with pure water , 

$ 18:10:23 let's hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering ; for he who promised is faithful . 

$ 18:10:24 Let's consider how to provoke one another to love and good works , 

$ 18:10:25 not forsaking our own assembling together , as the custom of some is , but exhorting one another ; and so much the more , as you see the Day approaching . 

$ 18:10:26 For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth , there remains no more a sacrifice for sins , 

$ 18:10:27 but a certain fearful expectation of judgment , and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries . 

$ 18:10:28 A man who disregards Moses' law dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses . 

$ 18:10:29 How much worse punishment do you think he will be judged worthy of who has trodden under foot the Son of God , and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified an unholy thing , and has insulted the Spirit of grace ? 

$ 18:10:30 For we know him who said , <" Vengeance belongs to me , >" says the Lord , <" I will repay . >" Again , <" The Lord will judge his people . >" 

$ 18:10:31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God . 

$ 18:10:32 But remember the former days , in which , after you were enlightened , you endured a great struggle with sufferings ; 

$ 18:10:33 partly , being exposed to both reproaches and oppressions ; and partly , becoming partakers with those who were treated so . 

$ 18:10:34 For you both had compassion on me in my chains , and joyfully accepted the plundering of your possessions , knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens . 

$ 18:10:35 Therefore don't throw away your boldness , which has a great reward . 

$ 18:10:36 For you need endurance so that , having done the will of God , you may receive the promise . 

$ 18:10:37 <" In a very little while , he who comes will come , and will not wait . 

$ 18:10:38 But the righteous will live by faith . If he shrinks back , my soul has no pleasure in him . >" 

$ 18:10:39 But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction , but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul . 


$ 18:11:1 Now faith is assurance of things hoped for , proof of things not seen . 

$ 18:11:2 For by this , the elders obtained testimony . 

$ 18:11:3 By faith , we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God , so that what is seen has not been made out of things which are visible . 

$ 18:11:4 By faith , Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain , through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous , God testifying with respect to his gifts ; and through it he , being dead , still speaks . 

$ 18:11:5 By faith , Enoch was taken away , so that he wouldn't see death , and he was not found , because God translated him . For he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God . 

$ 18:11:6 Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him , for he who comes to God must believe that he exists , and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him . 

$ 18:11:7 By faith , Noah , being warned about things not yet seen , moved with godly fear , prepared a ship for the saving of his house , through which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith . 

$ 18:11:8 By faith , Abraham , when he was called , obeyed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an inheritance . He went out , not knowing where he went . 

$ 18:11:9 By faith , he lived as an alien in the land of promise , as in a land not his own , dwelling in tents , with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise . 

$ 18:11:10 For he looked for the city which has the foundations , whose builder and maker is God . 

$ 18:11:11 By faith , even Sarah herself received power to conceive , and she bore a child when she was past age , since she counted him faithful who had promised . 

$ 18:11:12 Therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore , were fathered by one man , and him as good as dead . 

$ 18:11:13 These all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them and embraced them from afar , and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth . 

$ 18:11:14 For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own . 

$ 18:11:15 If indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out , they would have had enough time to return . 

$ 18:11:16 But now they desire a better country , that is , a heavenly one . Therefore God is not ashamed of them , to be called their God , for he has prepared a city for them . 

$ 18:11:17 By faith , Abraham , being tested , offered up Isaac . Yes , he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son , 

$ 18:11:18 to whom it was said , <" Your offspring will be accounted as from Isaac ; >" 

$ 18:11:19 concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead . Figuratively speaking , he also did receive him back from the dead . 

$ 18:11:20 By faith , Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau , even concerning things to come . 

$ 18:11:21 By faith , Jacob , when he was dying , blessed each of the sons of Joseph , and worshiped , leaning on the top of his staff . 

$ 18:11:22 By faith , Joseph , when his end was near , made mention of the departure of the children of Israel ; and gave instructions concerning his bones . 

$ 18:11:23 By faith , Moses , when he was born , was hidden for three months by his parents , because they saw that he was a beautiful child , and they were not afraid of the king's commandment . 

$ 18:11:24 By faith , Moses , when he had grown up , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter , 

$ 18:11:25 choosing rather to share ill treatment with God's people , than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time ; 

$ 18:11:26 accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt ; for he looked to the reward . 

$ 18:11:27 By faith , he left Egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king ; for he endured , as seeing him who is invisible . 

$ 18:11:28 By faith , he kept the Passover , and the sprinkling of the blood , that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them . 

$ 18:11:29 By faith , they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land . When the Egyptians tried to do so , they were swallowed up . 

$ 18:11:30 By faith , the walls of Jericho fell down , after they had been encircled for seven days . 

$ 18:11:31 By faith , Rahab the prostitute , didn't perish with those who were disobedient , having received the spies in peace . 

$ 18:11:32 What more shall I say ? For the time would fail me if I told of Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , David , Samuel , and the prophets ; 

$ 18:11:33 who , through faith subdued kingdoms , worked out righteousness , obtained promises , stopped the mouths of lions , 

$ 18:11:34 quenched the power of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , from weakness were made strong , grew mighty in war , and caused foreign armies to flee . 

$ 18:11:35 Women received their dead by resurrection . Others were tortured , not accepting their deliverance , that they might obtain a better resurrection . 

$ 18:11:36 Others were tried by mocking and scourging , yes , moreover by bonds and imprisonment . 

$ 18:11:37 They were stoned . They were sawn apart . They were tempted . They were slain with the sword . They went around in sheep skins and in goat skins ; being destitute , afflicted , ill - treated 

$ 18:11:38 ( of whom the world was not worthy ) , wandering in deserts , mountains , caves , and the holes of the earth . 

$ 18:11:39 These all , having had testimony given to them through their faith , didn't receive the promise , 

$ 18:11:40 God having provided some better thing concerning us , so that apart from us they should not be made perfect . 


$ 18:12:1 Therefore let's also , seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses , lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us , and let's run with perseverance the race that is set before us , 

$ 18:12:2 looking to Jesus , the author and perfecter of faith , who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , despising its shame , and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God . 

$ 18:12:3 For consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself , that you don't grow weary , fainting in your souls . 

$ 18:12:4 You have not yet resisted to blood , striving against sin ; 

$ 18:12:5 and you have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children , <" My son , don't take lightly the chastening of the Lord , nor faint when you are reproved by him ; 

$ 18:12:6 For whom the Lord loves , he chastens , and scourges every son whom he receives . >" 

$ 18:12:7 It is for discipline that you endure . God deals with you as with children , for what son is there whom his father doesn't discipline ? 

$ 18:12:8 But if you are without discipline , of which all have been made partakers , then are you illegitimate , and not children . 

$ 18:12:9 Furthermore , we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us , and we paid them respect . Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits , and live ? 

$ 18:12:10 For they indeed , for a few days , punished us as seemed good to them ; but he for our profit , that we may be partakers of his holiness . 

$ 18:12:11 All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous ; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby . 

$ 18:12:12 Therefore lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees , 

$ 18:12:13 and make straight paths for your feet , so what is lame may not be dislocated , but rather be healed . 

$ 18:12:14 Follow after peace with all men , and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord , 

$ 18:12:15 looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God ; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you , and many be defiled by it ; 

$ 18:12:16 lest there be any sexually immoral person , or profane person , like Esau , who sold his birthright for one meal . 

$ 18:12:17 For you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing , he was rejected , for he found no place for a change of mind though he sought it diligently with tears . 

$ 18:12:18 For you have not come to a mountain that might be touched , and that burned with fire , and to blackness , darkness , storm , 

$ 18:12:19 the sound of a trumpet , and the voice of words ; which those who heard it begged that not one more word should be spoken to them , 

$ 18:12:20 for they could not stand that which was commanded , <" If even an animal touches the mountain , it shall be stoned >" ; 

$ 18:12:21 and so fearful was the appearance that Moses said , <" I am terrified and trembling . >" 

$ 18:12:22 But you have come to Mount Zion , and to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to innumerable multitudes of angels , 

$ 18:12:23 to the festal gathering and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven , to God the Judge of all , to the spirits of just men made perfect , 

$ 18:12:24 to Jesus , the mediator of a new covenant , and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than that of Abel . 

$ 18:12:25 See that you don't refuse him who speaks . For if they didn't escape when they refused him who warned on the earth , how much more will we not escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven , 

$ 18:12:26 whose voice shook the earth then , but now he has promised , saying , <" Yet once more I will shake not only the earth , but also the heavens . >" 

$ 18:12:27 This phrase , <" Yet once more >" , signifies the removing of those things that are shaken , as of things that have been made , that those things which are not shaken may remain . 

$ 18:12:28 Therefore , receiving a Kingdom that can't be shaken , let's have grace , through which we serve God acceptably , with reverence and awe , 

$ 18:12:29 for our God is a consuming fire . 


$ 18:13:1 Let brotherly love continue . 

$ 18:13:2 Don't forget to show hospitality to strangers , for in doing so , some have entertained angels without knowing it . 

$ 18:13:3 Remember those who are in bonds , as bound with them ; and those who are ill - treated , since you are also in the body . 

$ 18:13:4 Let marriage be held in honor among all , and let the bed be undefiled : but God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers . 

$ 18:13:5 Be free from the love of money , content with such things as you have , for he has said , <" I will in no way leave you , neither will I in any way forsake you . >" 

$ 18:13:6 So that with good courage we say , <" The Lord is my helper . I will not fear . What can man do to me ? >" 

$ 18:13:7 Remember your leaders , men who spoke to you the word of God , and considering the results of their conduct , imitate their faith . 

$ 18:13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday , today , and forever . 

$ 18:13:9 Don't be carried away by various and strange teachings , for it is good that the heart be established by grace , not by food , through which those who were so occupied were not benefited . 

$ 18:13:10 We have an altar from which those who serve the holy tabernacle have no right to eat . 

$ 18:13:11 For the bodies of those animals , whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin , are burned outside of the camp . 

$ 18:13:12 Therefore Jesus also , that he might sanctify the people through his own blood , suffered outside of the gate . 

$ 18:13:13 Let's therefore go out to him outside of the camp , bearing his reproach . 

$ 18:13:14 For we don't have here an enduring city , but we seek that which is to come . 

$ 18:13:15 Through him , then , let's offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually , that is , the fruit of lips which proclaim allegiance to his name . 

$ 18:13:16 But don't forget to be doing good and sharing , for with such sacrifices God is well pleased . 

$ 18:13:17 Obey your leaders and submit to them , for they watch on behalf of your souls , as those who will give account , that they may do this with joy , and not with groaning , for that would be unprofitable for you . 

$ 18:13:18 Pray for us , for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience , desiring to live honorably in all things . 

$ 18:13:19 I strongly urge you to do this , that I may be restored to you sooner . 

$ 18:13:20 Now may the God of peace , who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant , our Lord Jesus , 

$ 18:13:21 make you complete in every good work to do his will , working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ , to whom be the glory forever and ever . Amen . 

$ 18:13:22 But I exhort you , brothers , endure the word of exhortation ; for I have written to you in few words . 

$ 18:13:23 Know that our brother Timothy has been freed , with whom , if he comes shortly , I will see you . 

$ 18:13:24 Greet all of your leaders and all the saints . The Italians greet you . 

$ 18:13:25 Grace be with you all . Amen .
