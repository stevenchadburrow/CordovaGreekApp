$ 24:1:1 How the city sits solitary , that was full of people ! She has become as a widow , who was great among the nations ! She who was a princess among the provinces has become a slave ! 

$ 24:1:2 She weeps bitterly in the night . Her tears are on her cheeks . Among all her lovers she has no one to comfort her . All her friends have dealt treacherously with her . They have become her enemies . 

$ 24:1:3 Judah has gone into captivity because of affliction , and because of great servitude . She dwells among the nations . She finds no rest . All her persecutors overtook her within the straits . 

$ 24:1:4 The roads to Zion mourn , because no one comes to the solemn assembly . All her gates are desolate . Her priests sigh . Her virgins are afflicted , and she herself is in bitterness . 

$ 24:1:5 Her adversaries have become the head . Her enemies prosper ; for Yahweh has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions . Her young children have gone into captivity before the adversary . 

$ 24:1:6 All majesty has departed from the daughter of Zion . Her princes have become like deer that find no pasture . They have gone without strength before the pursuer . 

$ 24:1:7 Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that were from the days of old ; when her people fell into the hand of the adversary , and no one helped her . The adversaries saw her . They mocked at her desolations . 

$ 24:1:8 Jerusalem has grievously sinned . Therefore she has become unclean . All who honored her despise her , because they have seen her nakedness . Yes , she sighs , and turns backward . 

$ 24:1:9 Her filthiness was in her skirts . She didn't remember her latter end . Therefore she has come down astoundingly . She has no comforter . <" See , Yahweh , my affliction ; for the enemy has magnified himself . >" 

$ 24:1:10 The adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things ; for she has seen that the nations have entered into her sanctuary , concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly . 

$ 24:1:11 All her people sigh . They seek bread . They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh their soul . <" Look , Yahweh , and see ; for I have become despised . >" 

$ 24:1:12 <" Is it nothing to you , all you who pass by ? Look , and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow , which is brought on me , with which Yahweh has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger . 

$ 24:1:13 <" From on high has he sent fire into my bones , and it prevails against them . He has spread a net for my feet . He has turned me back . He has made me desolate and I faint all day long . 

$ 24:1:14 <" The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand . They are knit together . They have come up on my neck . He made my strength fail . The Lord has delivered me into their hands , against whom I am not able to stand . 

$ 24:1:15 <" The Lord has set at nothing all my mighty men within me . He has called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men . The Lord has trodden the virgin daughter of Judah as in a wine press . 

$ 24:1:16 <" For these things I weep . My eye , my eye runs down with water , because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me . My children are desolate , because the enemy has prevailed . >" 

$ 24:1:17 Zion spreads out her hands . There is no one to comfort her . Yahweh has commanded concerning Jacob , that those who are around him should be his adversaries . Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing . 

$ 24:1:18 <" Yahweh is righteous ; for I have rebelled against his commandment . Please hear all you peoples , and see my sorrow . My virgins and my young men have gone into captivity . 

$ 24:1:19 <" I called for my lovers , but they deceived me . My priests and my elders gave up the spirit in the city , while they sought food for themselves to refresh their souls . 

$ 24:1:20 <" Look , Yahweh ; for I am in distress . My heart is troubled . My heart turns over within me , for I have grievously rebelled . Abroad , the sword bereaves . At home , it is like death . 

$ 24:1:21 <" They have heard that I sigh . There is no one to comfort me . All my enemies have heard of my trouble . They are glad that you have done it . You will bring the day that you have proclaimed , and they will be like me . 

$ 24:1:22 <" Let all their wickedness come before you . Do to them as you have done to me for all my transgressions . For my sighs are many , and my heart is faint . 


$ 24:2:1 How has the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger ! He has cast the beauty of Israel down from heaven to the earth , and hasn't remembered his footstool in the day of his anger . 

$ 24:2:2 The Lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob without pity . He has thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah . He has brought them down to the ground . He has profaned the kingdom and its princes . 

$ 24:2:3 He has cut off all the horn of Israel in fierce anger . He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy . He has burned up Jacob like a flaming fire , which devours all around . 

$ 24:2:4 He has bent his bow like an enemy . He has stood with his right hand as an adversary . Has killed all that were pleasant to the eye . In the tent of the daughter of Zion , he has poured out his wrath like fire . 

$ 24:2:5 The Lord has become as an enemy . He has swallowed up Israel . He has swallowed up all her palaces . He has destroyed his strongholds . He has multiplied mourning and lamentation in the daughter of Judah . 

$ 24:2:6 He has violently taken away his tabernacle , as if it were of a garden . He has destroyed his place of assembly . Yahweh has caused solemn assembly and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion . In the indignation of his anger , he has despised the king and the priest . 

$ 24:2:7 The Lord has cast off his altar . He has abhorred his sanctuary . He has given the walls of her palaces into the hand of the enemy . They have made a noise in Yahweh's house , as in the day of a solemn assembly . 

$ 24:2:8 Yahweh has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion . He has stretched out the line . He has not withdrawn his hand from destroying ; He has made the rampart and wall lament . They languish together . 

$ 24:2:9 Her gates have sunk into the ground . He has destroyed and broken her bars . Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not . Yes , her prophets find no vision from Yahweh . 

$ 24:2:10 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground . They keep silence . They have cast up dust on their heads . They have clothed themselves with sackcloth . The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground . 

$ 24:2:11 My eyes fail with tears . My heart is troubled . My liver is poured on the earth , because of the destruction of the daughter of my people , because the young children and the infants swoon in the streets of the city . 

$ 24:2:12 They ask their mothers , <" Where is grain and wine ? >" when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city , when their soul is poured out into their mothers' bosom . 

$ 24:2:13 What shall I testify to you ? What shall I liken to you , daughter of Jerusalem ? What shall I compare to you , that I may comfort you , virgin daughter of Zion ? For your breach is as big as the sea . Who can heal you ? 

$ 24:2:14 Your prophets have seen false and foolish visions for you . They have not uncovered your iniquity , to reverse your captivity , but have seen for you false revelations and causes of banishment . 

$ 24:2:15 All that pass by clap their hands at you . They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem , saying , <" Is this the city that men called <' The perfection of beauty , the joy of the whole earth >' ? >" 

$ 24:2:16 All your enemies have opened their mouth wide against you . They hiss and gnash their teeth . They say , <" We have swallowed her up . Certainly this is the day that we looked for . We have found it . We have seen it . >" 

$ 24:2:17 Yahweh has done that which he planned . He has fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old . He has thrown down , and has not pitied . He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you . He has exalted the horn of your adversaries . 

$ 24:2:18 Their heart cried to the Lord . O wall of the daughter of Zion , let tears run down like a river day and night . Give yourself no relief . Don't let the your eyes rest . 

$ 24:2:19 Arise , cry out in the night , at the beginning of the watches ! Pour out your heart like water before the face of the Lord . Lift up your hands toward him for the life of your young children , who faint for hunger at the head of every street . 

$ 24:2:20 <" Look , Yahweh , and see to whom you have done thus ! Should the women eat their offspring , the children that they held and bounced on their knees ? Should the priest and the prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the Lord ? 

$ 24:2:21 <" The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets . My virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword . You have killed them in the day of your anger . You have slaughtered , and not pitied . 

$ 24:2:22 <" You have called , as in the day of a solemn assembly , my terrors on every side . There was no one that escaped or remained in the day of Yahweh's anger . My enemy has consumed those whom I have cared for and brought up . 


$ 24:3:1 I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath . 

$ 24:3:2 He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness , and not in light . 

$ 24:3:3 Surely he turns his hand against me again and again all day long . 

$ 24:3:4 He has made my flesh and my skin old . He has broken my bones . 

$ 24:3:5 He has built against me , and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship . 

$ 24:3:6 He has made me dwell in dark places , as those who have been long dead . 

$ 24:3:7 He has walled me about , so that I can't go out . He has made my chain heavy . 

$ 24:3:8 Yes , when I cry , and call for help , he shuts out my prayer . 

$ 24:3:9 He has walled up my ways with cut stone . He has made my paths crooked . 

$ 24:3:10 He is to me as a bear lying in wait , as a lion in secret places . 

$ 24:3:11 He has turned away my ways , and pulled me in pieces . He has made me desolate . 

$ 24:3:12 He has bent his bow , and set me as a mark for the arrow . 

$ 24:3:13 He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys . 

$ 24:3:14 I have become a derision to all my people , and their song all day long . 

$ 24:3:15 He has filled me with bitterness . He has stuffed me with wormwood . 

$ 24:3:16 He has also broken my teeth with gravel . He has covered me with ashes . 

$ 24:3:17 You have removed my soul far away from peace . I forgot prosperity . 

$ 24:3:18 I said , <" My strength has perished , along with my expectation from Yahweh . >" 

$ 24:3:19 Remember my affliction and my misery , the wormwood and the bitterness . 

$ 24:3:20 My soul still remembers them , and is bowed down within me . 

$ 24:3:21 This I recall to my mind ; therefore I have hope . 

$ 24:3:22 It is because of Yahweh's loving kindnesses that we are not consumed , because his compassion doesn't fail . 

$ 24:3:23 They are new every morning . Great is your faithfulness . 

$ 24:3:24 <" Yahweh is my portion , >" says my soul . <" Therefore I will hope in him . >" 

$ 24:3:25 Yahweh is good to those who wait for him , to the soul who seeks him . 

$ 24:3:26 It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh . 

$ 24:3:27 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth . 

$ 24:3:28 Let him sit alone and keep silence , because he has laid it on him . 

$ 24:3:29 Let him put his mouth in the dust , if it is so that there may be hope . 

$ 24:3:30 Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him . Let him be filled full of reproach . 

$ 24:3:31 For the Lord will not cast off forever . 

$ 24:3:32 For though he causes grief , yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses . 

$ 24:3:33 For he does not afflict willingly , nor grieve the children of men . 

$ 24:3:34 To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth , 

$ 24:3:35 to turn away the right of a man before the face of the Most High , 

$ 24:3:36 to subvert a man in his cause , the Lord doesn't approve . 

$ 24:3:37 Who is he who says , and it comes to pass , when the Lord doesn't command it ? 

$ 24:3:38 Doesn't evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High ? 

$ 24:3:39 Why does a living man complain , a man for the punishment of his sins ? 

$ 24:3:40 Let us search and try our ways , and turn again to Yahweh . 

$ 24:3:41 Let's lift up our heart with our hands to God in the heavens . 

$ 24:3:42 <" We have transgressed and have rebelled . You have not pardoned . 

$ 24:3:43 <" You have covered us with anger and pursued us . You have killed . You have not pitied . 

$ 24:3:44 You have covered yourself with a cloud , so that no prayer can pass through . 

$ 24:3:45 You have made us an off - scouring and refuse in the middle of the peoples . 

$ 24:3:46 <" All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us . 

$ 24:3:47 Terror and the pit have come on us , devastation and destruction . >" 

$ 24:3:48 My eye runs down with streams of water , for the destruction of the daughter of my people . 

$ 24:3:49 My eye pours down and doesn't cease , without any intermission , 

$ 24:3:50 until Yahweh looks down , and sees from heaven . 

$ 24:3:51 My eye affects my soul , because of all the daughters of my city . 

$ 24:3:52 They have chased me relentlessly like a bird , those who are my enemies without cause . 

$ 24:3:53 They have cut off my life in the dungeon , and have cast a stone on me . 

$ 24:3:54 Waters flowed over my head . I said , <" I am cut off . >" 

$ 24:3:55 I called on your name , Yahweh , out of the lowest dungeon . 

$ 24:3:56 You heard my voice : <" Don't hide your ear from my sighing , and my cry . >" 

$ 24:3:57 You came near in the day that I called on you . You said , <" Don't be afraid . >" 

$ 24:3:58 Lord , you have pleaded the causes of my soul . You have redeemed my life . 

$ 24:3:59 Yahweh , you have seen my wrong . Judge my cause . 

$ 24:3:60 You have seen all their vengeance and all their plans against me . 

$ 24:3:61 You have heard their reproach , Yahweh , and all their plans against me , 

$ 24:3:62 the lips of those that rose up against me , and their plots against me all day long . 

$ 24:3:63 You see their sitting down and their rising up . I am their song . 

$ 24:3:64 You will pay them back , Yahweh , according to the work of their hands . 

$ 24:3:65 You will give them hardness of heart , your curse to them . 

$ 24:3:66 You will pursue them in anger , and destroy them from under the heavens of Yahweh . 


$ 24:4:1 How the gold has become dim ! The most pure gold has changed ! The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street . 

$ 24:4:2 The precious sons of Zion , comparable to fine gold , how they are esteemed as earthen pitchers , the work of the hands of the potter ! 

$ 24:4:3 Even the jackals offer their breast . They nurse their young ones . But the daughter of my people has become cruel , like the ostriches in the wilderness . 

$ 24:4:4 The tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst . The young children ask bread , and no one breaks it for them . 

$ 24:4:5 Those who ate delicacies are desolate in the streets . Those who were brought up in purple embrace dunghills . 

$ 24:4:6 For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom , which was overthrown as in a moment . No hands were laid on her . 

$ 24:4:7 Her nobles were purer than snow . They were whiter than milk . They were more ruddy in body than rubies . Their polishing was like sapphire . 

$ 24:4:8 Their appearance is blacker than a coal . They are not known in the streets . Their skin clings to their bones . It is withered . It has become like a stick . 

$ 24:4:9 Those who are killed with the sword are better than those who are killed with hunger ; For these pine away , stricken through , for lack of the fruits of the field . 

$ 24:4:10 The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children . They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people . 

$ 24:4:11 Yahweh has accomplished his wrath . He has poured out his fierce anger . He has kindled a fire in Zion , which has devoured its foundations . 

$ 24:4:12 The kings of the earth didn't believe , neither did all the inhabitants of the world , that the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem . 

$ 24:4:13 It is because of the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests , That have shed the blood of the just in the middle of her . 

$ 24:4:14 They wander as blind men in the streets . They are polluted with blood , So that men can't touch their garments . 

$ 24:4:15 <" Go away ! >" they cried to them . <" Unclean ! Go away ! Go away ! Don't touch ! When they fled away and wandered , men said among the nations , <" They can't live here any more . >" 

$ 24:4:16 Yahweh's anger has scattered them . He will not pay attention to them any more . They didn't respect the persons of the priests . They didn't favor the elders . 

$ 24:4:17 Our eyes still fail , looking in vain for our help . In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save . 

$ 24:4:18 They hunt our steps , so that we can't go in our streets . Our end is near . Our days are fulfilled , for our end has come . 

$ 24:4:19 Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky . They chased us on the mountains . They set an ambush for us in the wilderness . 

$ 24:4:20 The breath of our nostrils , the anointed of Yahweh , was taken in their pits ; of whom we said , under his shadow we will live among the nations . 

$ 24:4:21 Rejoice and be glad , daughter of Edom , that dwells in the land of Uz . The cup will pass through to you also . You will be drunken , and will make yourself naked . 

$ 24:4:22 The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished , daughter of Zion . He will no more carry you away into captivity . He will visit your iniquity , daughter of Edom . He will uncover your sins . 


$ 24:5:1 Remember , Yahweh , what has come on us . Look , and see our reproach . 

$ 24:5:2 Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers , our houses to aliens . 

$ 24:5:3 We are orphans and fatherless . Our mothers are as widows . 

$ 24:5:4 We have drunken our water for money . Our wood is sold to us . 

$ 24:5:5 Our pursuers are on our necks . We are weary , and have no rest . 

$ 24:5:6 We have given our hands to the Egyptians , and to the Assyrians , to be satisfied with bread . 

$ 24:5:7 Our fathers sinned , and are no more . We have borne their iniquities . 

$ 24:5:8 Servants rule over us . There is no one to deliver us out of their hand . 

$ 24:5:9 We get our bread at the peril of our lives , because of the sword of the wilderness . 

$ 24:5:10 Our skin is black like an oven , because of the burning heat of famine . 

$ 24:5:11 They ravished the women in Zion , the virgins in the cities of Judah . 

$ 24:5:12 Princes were hanged up by their hands . The faces of elders were not honored . 

$ 24:5:13 The young men carry millstones . The children stumbled under loads of wood . 

$ 24:5:14 The elders have ceased from the gate , and the young men from their music . 

$ 24:5:15 The joy of our heart has ceased . Our dance is turned into mourning . 

$ 24:5:16 The crown has fallen from our head . Woe to us , for we have sinned ! 

$ 24:5:17 For this our heart is faint . For these things our eyes are dim . 

$ 24:5:18 For the mountain of Zion , which is desolate . The foxes walk on it . 

$ 24:5:19 You , Yahweh , remain forever . Your throne is from generation to generation . 

$ 24:5:20 Why do you forget us forever , and forsake us for so long a time ? 

$ 24:5:21 Turn us to yourself , Yahweh , and we will be turned . Renew our days as of old . 

$ 24:5:22 But you have utterly rejected us . You are very angry against us .
